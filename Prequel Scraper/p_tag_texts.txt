Today is the beginning of the new you.
One month ago you made yourself a promise: you were going to turn your life around. You were going to get a real job, stay out of jail, and not get into any more trouble with cults. Nobody thought you could do it; they said your questionable reputation, lack of any useful skills, and flagrant alcoholism would always hold you down. 
But you had a plan. 
You were going to start over, far from home. You pawned off your belongings, withdrew the rest of your inheritance, and narrowly managed to buy your way onto a merchant ship bound for Cyrodiil.
And now you have arrived, alone and penniless in a foreign country. Rounding up to the nearest week, you’ve been sober for an entire seven days. This is your chance to be whatever you want to be. Whoever you want to be. 
You think you’ll start with a new name. Something less ethnic, maybe suitably Imperial, to fit in in your new home. 

N.. no… NO!
There is something far too… royal about that name. Something that strikes fear in your soul.
You’ve never understood why kings scare you. Maybe it’s those crowns – jagged rims glistening like a dozen metal teeth burst forth from their skull, a vestigial maw seeking to devour any so unfortunate to find themselves upon it. Maybe it’s their clothes – an ocean of sparkling purple silk dragged behind them like the vicious tendrils of an unholy carnivorous plant. Maybe it’s their very expression – the way it oozes that solemn, dutiful dedication to their country. 
“Scare” might even be too weak a word. Dukes terrify you, as do Princes, Counts, and Barons. But Kings, Queens, Emperors… you don’t know what you’d do if you ever found yourself face-to-face with one. Probably curl up and cry. 
You used to have a recurring nightmare where you were trapped in a small, dark room with a King. There’s no way out. No one to help you. And he just stands there, being a king. Luckily, you’ve mostly taken care of your nightmare problem through heavy self-medication. Though you guess the self-medication became the bigger problem.
This name sounds pretty cool though. You like the way it rolls off your sandpapery tongue. You jot it down and hand the immigration form to the guard. 
The guard says you can keep it if you want. They don’t actually keep track of immigration, and he only brought the form because you asked. He’s just going to throw it out. 
You tell him you don’t care. This has symbolic value to you. It makes your new life feel official. He obliges and accepts the document. 
Not many people out here; everyone must be inside. Looks like there’s some shops near the dock. One appears to be a general store, the other some kind of restaurant. 

Your… trade skills? You always get a little uncomfortable when the T-word pops into your head. 
Suffice to say, your childhood was not full of encouragement, your adolescence was not full of employment, and your adulthood has not been full of success. Each one sort of led into the next, which is to say “nowhere”. It’s one of the things you’re hoping to fix in your new life. Someday, you’ll be good at something. Or even just adequate at it. It would make you so happy.  
But for the time being you’re pretty much worthless. I mean, you know a pretty interesting party trick involving a yoyo and a pineapple, but… it’s not appropriate for most parties.
You think it’s supposed to be a bag of swords, but you’re not sure. It’s pretty much the worst sign you’ve ever seen. You can barely read it. 
If you need some quick cash later maybe you can offer to redesign it.

Right now, however, your best bet for steady employment seems to be the restaurant. And hey, you’re Cyrodiillian now, may as well get to know the locals. 
You head in. This place is pretty nice, you guess. Sort of homey. 
The proprietor is some kind of elf. There’s like a billion kinds of elves, you can never keep them straight. He welcomes you to The Flowing Bowl and asks if you would like to see a menu. 

This is definitely a menu meant for sailors. You guess that’s what you have to expect at a port town. It’s all out of your price range, too – that is to say, nothing is free.
But you’re not going to let that bring your spirits down. You compliment the elf on his fine seaside establishment and alluring menu, then clumsily segue into how you are broke and looking for a job. Maybe he needs a maid to clean up at the end of the day, or a waitress to service tables? Or someone to do both for the wage of one?
Him and his brother manage to handle all the chores around here, he explains. There’s not really any need for a third employee, no matter how many jobs she was willing to take up and how little wage she was willing to accept. Between the two of them, there is more than enough manpower to keep the food cooked, sailors fed, the tables spotless.
You have a sneaking suspicion they aren’t actually brothers. 
You’ve been in Cyrodiil for all of fifteen minutes and your ambitious dreams of starting anew are already feeling a bit shakier. You confess that you didn’t plan ahead very well and are in dire need of employment. Is there anyone in town who might need some menial labor? You’re willing to learn new skills. You’re scared and alone and just need a place to sleep and a way to put food on the table. 
The gay elves explain that many trading ships come through this port. If you have any valuable possessions, you may be able to sell them for a good price. If you don’t have any valuable possessions… well, maybe someone else will need a maid or something. You could ask around.
Your only possessions in the world right now are the clothes on your back and this lockpick you found on the floor of the ship. You have no idea how to use a lockpick. 

Excuse me but part of your plan was to stay out of jail this time. 
And you don’t really think a tin cup is going to play a very pivotal role in what you hope will be your rags-to-riches story. Though admittedly it would effectively double your wealth.
You can’t be a wizard.
Wizards have long flowy beards. You assume it is a prerequisite.
You ask the elves why they’re not at the emergency elf summit on elf island. Isn’t that where elfy elves have to go?
In retrospect your tone was probably a little too aggressive. 
They retort that there’s a sale on Fancy Feast at the Imperial City. Shouldn’t you be headed off that way? 
Cat jokes always cut you deep. That burn was so sick it lit the candle. 
It’s made slightly worse by the fact that you really would like some (cat)food.  
These gay elves are racist fucks and you don’t want to talk to them anymore. Maybe you’ll go check around for a bulletin board offering jobs, or ask that store owner if you can redesign his sign. You could try to sell your clothes, but that would just leave you with no pockets to hold your money and lockpick, and you’d probably get arrested for public indecency anyway. Or maybe you can forget about the whole “keep a good reputation” thing and go find a party where you can do your pineapple tri- oh hey that lady with the bottle is yelling something incoherent at you. Maybe you should reply, or just walk away very quickly.

Your special day can’t get any worse, you figure. Time to do something stupid.
You cautiously approach the crazy bottle lady.
She heard you were new in town. Yes, you reply. That’s cool, she says. She was new once too. She didn’t really know what to do with her life. Then she met some nice people in robes who gave her food and a place to stay and something to believe in but she’s not supposed to tell you about them. That’s okay, you say, you don’t want to know. She appreciates your non-prying-ness and declares you to be her best friend. 
She takes another swig and goes off on a tangent about how she left the peas on her plate because peas are the worst fruit. She’s not even entirely sure they are a fruit. She says you can have them if you want, but you say you’re not hungry. You also point out she is still waving a knife at you. She apologizes, sometimes she just knifes people.
You look thirsty, she says. You should have some of this awesome wine. In fact, you have to have some, it’s just that good. You nervously try to explain that you are a recovering alcoholic and have the booze tolerance of an anorexic six-year-old, but your new friend insists you are just pussying out. Pussy pussy pussy. She asks again if you would like a drink. 
Frankly, you would love a drink right now. Also she has a knife.

Your mind is filled with cunning plans and heroic maneuvers. A brave person wouldn’t be afraid to stand her ground. A skilled person would find a way to turn this situation to her advantage.
Unfortunately, you are neither of these things.
You abscond the fuck outta there and find a place to hide.
Okay, you’re pretty sure she’s not following you.

After spending the last several hours cowering behind the guard, you decide that this is an opportune moment to inquire as to whether you can join the city watch. You explain that you don’t have any experience and have never held a weapon in your life but you have a willingness to learn new things and will work very hard. One day, you say, you will be the best guard. What do you think?
The guard looks at you with a troubled, uncomfortable glare, like that of a man who must explain to his paraplegic daughter that her dreams of becoming a ballerina will never come true. He struggles to find the softest words, some gentle way to let you know that you’re not exactly what they want in a guard. You’re scrawny and unintimidating; nobody would ever say “hey, you should consider joining the guard”. They just don’t need you. 
Your astute senses pick up on his internal struggle. It is time to up the ante.
Maybe you could be a guard, he says. Usually guards are tough and brave but sometimes there are exceptions, perhaps? If you work hard enough you can accomplish your dreams, whatever they are. 
He doesn’t have the authority to accept you into the guard, though. You’ll have to go to the castle and speak to the Countess.
Suddenly becoming a guard doesn’t sound like such a great idea.  
You don’t really want to invite any cat jokes. You don’t know if your fragile ego can take it right now. May as well check out that store, though. 
You enter the store with the terrible sign.
The owner welcomes you to Lelles’ Quality Merchandise. He invites you to look around, and offers to answer any questions you might have. 

We’ve been through this already. You have no wizard beard! You don’t think it’s biologically possible for you to grow one either, at least without magic. It’s a catch-22.

You excitedly say hello to the nice man and explain that you have no money. But you wish you did, because his store is very nice and appears well-stocked! It is probably a lot of work running this store all by himself and you would be happy to help if he needed it. Did you mention you are broke? Sorry if you already mentioned that. 
Also it is a shame his wonderful store lacks an adequate sign to match.
What.
Is wrong with my sign?
Lelles says he was just joking. He didn’t mean to scare you. Please come back. 
He knows his sign is not very good, he tells you. He’s been planning to replace it, and even bought a new blank sign. However, he doesn’t want to ruin this expensive new sign with his abysmal handwriting. He’s been hoping to run into someone who was willing to help out. 
This is exciting! You should be excited. But your eyes are stuck on that damn bottle he left out in the open. 
Your mouth feels dry. You really want some alcohol.

Wessolf27 wrote: Resist urge to drink liquor and SHOW YOUR PENMANSHIP!!!  ShadowoftheLotus wrote: Offer to demonstrate your artistic talent on the back of the old sign!



Wait, you say, maybe you can fix it. It’s still much better than the original sign so maybe people won’t care about this one little mistake that you shouldn’t have made and oh gods it looks so stupid why did you do this you’re just making it worse. Now even people who don’t know how to spell will know you made a mistake. 
Your tears fail to magically fix the sign. 
It’s okay, Lelles tells you. You tried your best. Your “best” just happened to be slightly worse than everyone else’s “average”. He figures he can still use the sign, though people might think he’s kind of dumb because of it. You say you’re sorry, sorry sorry sorry, and ask if there is anything else you can do at all to make it up to him. He says no, he thinks you’ve done enough. You should go now. But you do deserve some compensation for your hard work.
You’ll happily accept less than ten, you say. Maybe eight Septims?
Oh shit no, lady. Lelles got a business to run here, and Lelles all about quality. He’ll give you one. 
Whatever.
You take your payment and leave. It’s cold and dark outside.
Maybe one Septim is all you are worth. Maybe everyone was right after all. You thought maybe if you went far away, you could leave it all behind and make something of yourself. You tried as hard as you could, and have a single coin to show for it. Lelles was right; your best just isn’t good enough.
You feel terrible. All you can think about is how wrong you were. How you ruined everything. 
You head back to The Flowing Bowl. There is exactly one thing you can afford right now, and you need it badly.

Because lets face it you’re a massive failure so you might as well start stealing from successful people. Vissia wrote: Pay one Septim for a good hug.

You are in no mood for heroics. It’s been a terrible day, and right now all you want to do is bring some little spark of happiness into your otherwise bleak life.  
You appreciate the encouragement and promise your next Septim will be toward something productive, but now just isn’t the best time. You’re sorry. 
You give the elf your coin and ask for whatever alcoholic drink that can buy. You ask him to water it down a bit, please. You don’t want to get wasted, you just want to drink enough to forget what a failure you are. 
You are apprehensive to succumb to your addiction, but you know you’ll feel better afterwards. That’s what matters right now. Maybe tomorrow will be better, if you can renew your spirit.
Maybe if you can bring back that feeling that you can do anything, then quitting again will just be another simple challenge to surmount. Then things will be better. You’ll make sure things are better next time. 
You’re sorry.
Bottoms up, you guess.
You fucked up.

Well, he has a tramp stamp but you’ll need to find a mirror if you want to check yourself. I mean, maybe he already had that one when you met him. 
You have no idea where your clothes are. But this appears to be a fishbowl full of peas. Evidently the fish couldn’t breathe peas. They truly are the worst fruit. 
You consider riding the unicorn, but to be honest you’d be kind of embarrassed to be seen on it. Are those flames on the side? You are pretty curious what it’s doing here, though.

That sword isn’t coming out. You might be able to pull the arrows out, though, but without your clothes you don’t really have anywhere to… sec
Okay, you still have your lockpick. That’s good you guess. 
You think it’s time to skip town and start over again over again. 

It’s purple paint, yeah. 
It looks like you tried to write a book last night. You can’t really bring yourself to read past the first page.
The orc is breathing. That’s a good sign. You peek under the bed.
Is that… a pineapple and a yoyo? Oh gods, it is. So much for a good reputation. 
You attempt to tailor the bedsheet into clothing, receiving an unpleasant reminder that you have no trade skills. You really should find some clothes though, before someone shows up.

It’s not a ladder! It’s a chair nailed upside down to the ceiling. It’s stuck there pretty well too. You think that’s all there is to say on the matter. 
The only way out of this room is the door. Well, or the second-story window lined with broken glass. 
You’re a little bit afraid to wake up the orc! I mean, you know nothing about him besides the fact that he’s twice your size and apparently threw a sword through the wall. And that he has a tattoo.
You nab those arrows though. 
You check the dresser. Just your luck; empty except for a folded piece of paper you can barely read.
Oh! Right! You almost forgot you could do that.
You switch on your darkvision.

You take the AAAH WAIT you forgot to turn off your darkvision.
Okay. Wow. You take the book, and slip a shard of broken window in there for good measure. You don’t know what kind of horrible secrets you wrote in that book. If it’s anything too dark you might have to stab yourself for reading it. 
Hey, that is pretty cool. Maybe things are finally turning around. You just woke up in a strange place with a strange man and you haven’t cried once.
I mean, the blood doesn’t count. That was a legitimate mistake on your part. 
Yeah, your clothworking experiments haven’t been turning out well. 
You peek out into the hallway. 
BEST IDEA.
Wait no this idea was retarded, why did you do this. You should’ve just wrapped that tapestry around yourself. You hope this paint is washable.
You hear a door being unlocked downstairs. 

> Paint some pants and turn that bra into a shirt
Hey, thanks! But you don’t really have enough paint left to do anything more, and really don’t want to invite “catsuit” jokes. 
Doable, except the strapless part. 
You hear a door opening downstairs. 
Someone is coming in. You figure worst case scenario, in your drunken state you inadvertently sought employment as a prostitute. Maybe this is the brothel proprietor returning?-
-Whoops, or not. This woman has some very valid questions about what you’re doing in her house. 

I am 70% sure that bows don’t work very well at close range!
Yes… you should be able to use the book to swat her bow out of the way and maybe deflect the arrow if she releases. Then you can threaten her with the shard of glass before she draws another oh gods who are you kidding she has a WEAPON. 
Between panicked sobs you attempt to explain that you have no idea how you got here. You had a little bit of ale at the docks and the next thing you know you woke up naked upstairs in bed with an orc you’ve never met and you think you really made a mess of her room and you’re sorry but please don’t kill me. If that orc was her husband you’re also sorry but you admire her progressive thinking on interspecies marriage and also you have very nice scales and please don’t hurt me I’ll do anything.
Woah woah woah she cuts you off.
It’s okay.
She just wanted to make sure you weren’t robbing the place, and she isn’t married to an orc. She admits she feels partially responsible for your predicament, since she was the one who got you that pineapple last night. And it was all pretty much downhill from there, once you did that thing with the yoyo and pineapple. In the town square. In fact, you probably shouldn’t show your face around town for a little while. You’re kind of a big conversation topic right now. 
But it’s okay. People won’t remember it forever. In her line of work, she explains, she knows firsthand how quickly you can be forgotten. How did you end up in this town anyway?
You tell her your story, about how you came to Cyrodiil yesterday without any money, thinking you could make friends and get a job and start over from the ground up. But you just messed up everything you tried and at the end of the day you felt so awful that you started drinking again. You’re really sorry and will do whatever you can to pay for the room you trashed.
That’s good, she says. She was already planning to ask if you’d pay for anything you broke. Now, what trade skills do you have and how much damage did you do to the room?

You nervously sidestep the topic and attempt to do introductions instead. Hi I’m Katia Managan, what’s your name and what do you do I guess. Sorry.
Oh gods, awkward silence. You should’ve jus-
She introduces herself as Quill-Weave. She’s a novelist, and mostly writes stories about the gritty, merciless struggles of the lower classes. She admits that might be why she finds you interesting; you have basically introduced her to a whole new level of lower-class. You thank her, but aren’t really sure if it was a compliment.  
You go ahead and explain that her room is pretty much totaled. There’s paint all over the place, several punctures through her wall, a broken window, a shredded bedsheet, a defaced book, and a pimped-out unicorn prowling around. You also apparently killed her fish. She tells you not to worry about the fish, though. She actually hates all pets, and only gets them to watch them die. She says it’s a writer thing, you wouldn’t understand. 
You tell her that you’re willing to do whatever you can to make the damages up to her. Maybe you could clean up? You’re also okay at painting, maybe that could come in handy? She subtly implies that she isn’t ready to trust you with paint, but says she may have something you can help with…
She’s leaving tonight to do some research for her next book, but needs this letter delivered to the nearby city of Kvatch as soon as possible. All you’d have to do is travel to Kvatch, deliver the letter to the local bookstore, and then return with the reply. While you’re there, you could pick up a new copy of the book you defaced. 
She’ll give you money for the new book, as well as enough for you to spend the night at Kvatch before you head back. She’s willing to trust you with the money, since she needs this letter delivered quickly and she’s found no one else available.
At most, it would take two days round-trip. She is confident that absolutely nothing could possibly go wrong. 
You are ecstatic. You promise you won’t let her down and that you will be the best and swiftest letter-deliverer Cyrodiil has ever encountered. Quill-Weave uncomfortably chokes out that first she’s going to go buy some clothes for you and your orc friend. What do you usually like?
You ask her what she means.
She wants to know what kind of clothes you like to wear. She wants to help you get back on the right foot – that is to say, properly fed and clothed – and she has never actually seen you when you weren’t naked. Maybe you could just, like, draw how you like to dress? She could try to find something close to it.  
This is the first time in your entire life anyone has ever asked what you like. Regarding anything. You have never thought about it before. 

She kind of accidentally into a pirate somewhere along the way.
You have the best idea. There’s going to be armor and jingly bells and rocket boots that shoot lightning and a fake beard and wait this is stupid and unrealistic. You start over.
How’s this, on the right?
Quill-Weave says she should have no problem finding something just like that, since this is a seaside town. She also throws in a nice compliment about your drawing skills, which brightens your mood a bit. 
She’s been meaning to buy some new outfits for herself anyway so she’ll be back in an hour or so. She’ll answer any more questions you have when she gets back; until then feel free to help yourself to whatever’s in her kitche-
Hello ladies.
Has anyone seen a pair of red trousers?
Quill-Weave quickly says something about how she’s confident you two can work this out on your own okay see you later. 

Hey Honeybuns, how’s it hanging? It’s always hanging amazing. That’s the answer.
The orc introduces himself as Gharug gro-Upp. He overheard you talking to that fine piece of scale; sounds like she’s not too happy about the room! But that’s okay, he’ll pitch in. He always keeps some coins lodged between his luscious, steely pecs in case something like this happens. Check it:
KABOOM!
Pretty fucking amazing, right? 
He explains that he knows a guy in Kvatch who can get this lady’s walls and windows fixed on the cheap. Just take this gold up to Kvatch and find someone named Fixes-Homes. He’ll get this place back how it should be. Gharug says the gold he was packing between his massive, toned chest muscles should be just enough to cover the repairs.
You uneasily thank Gharug for his contribution. You ask him if he’ll be joining you on your trip to Kvatch, but he declines. He’s got to get his leave on, if you know what he’s saying. (He’s saying he has to leave.)
Take care, Butterscotch, and thanks for the sweet lay.
Before you can say anything else or mention Quill-Weave is out buying clothes, Gharug gets his leave on.
You’re not entirely sure how to feel about this.

Okay, you guess he’s not the weirdest thing you’ve had drunken sex with. You’ve done worse, yeah. 
This isn’t making you feel any better about yourself. 
It’s not a blanket, it’s a tapestry! The difference, as you understand it, is about ten gold. 
Regardless, you gather up your money, book, tapestry, arrows, glass shard, and lockpick and check out the kitchen. This stuff you’re lugging around is getting rather cumbersome, you should probably ditch some of it or find a better way to carry it. 

Look, it’s not important, okay? You made mistakes, you know that. That was the old you. You’re trying to leave that behind so you can focus on more productive things. 
Like this nifty hobo bindle you just made!
It turned out way better than your Fruity Tote. That was a pretty terrible idea.
As an added bonus, one of Quill-Weave’s brooms has been turned into a much more serviceable scrub brush. 
Alas, these poor flowers appear to be another tragic victim of Quill-Weave’s inadequate pet care. Any water that was once in this vase has long since evaporated, leaving the innocent plants to die of thirst. There was no way for them to escape their fate, but at least until the very end they had eachother.
You hope they find their way to flower heaven.
They’ll receive a proper cremation next time she lights her fireplace. 
Sounds like a plan.
The other door is stuck. Maybe something sticky spilled over there? You grope around the other side a bit but it just feels like some more bottles. 

Yeah, you’ve probably taken enough of Quill-Weave’s stuff. You already owe her a lot, both figuratively and literally. It’d be rude to keep taking advantage of her hospitality. Anyway, that bottle is making you think things you don’t want to think about. 
You clear your mind by cleaning up that mess you made with the watermelon. It’s too bad your idea to hollow it out and turn it into a Fruity Tote didn’t work out. That would’ve been pretty neat. 
Wait, you hear the front door.
You welcome Quill-Weave back and tell her that the orc already left, nude. You both agree that was pretty weird of him; maybe it’s some orc thing you don’t understand. You also mention that you used her tapestry to make a bag to carry some supplies, you hope she doesn’t mind? She says it’s fine. It’s not even a real tapestry, it’s actually just a blanket she hung up like one. 
Here’s some clothes. She hopes they’re close enough to what y-
Huh. You got those on fast. Laces and everything.
You explain that you’ve always been remarkably quick at getting in and out of clothing. Some people would consider this a skill, but for you it’s always been more of a liability. She understands. Anyway, you can’t imagine this ability ever having any practical applications, ever. 
Now that you’re fed and decent, here’s the letter, 25 Septims, and a map of Cyrodiil. You just need to head northeast along the Gold Road until you get to Kvatch, take this letter to the proprietor of the bookstore, and wait for his response. In that same store you’ll be able to get a new copy of the book you ruined; it should be about ten Septims, leaving you fifteen for food and lodging.
You mention that you’ve heard some bad stories about travelling alone. The trip won’t be… dangerous, will it?
She says as long as you stick to the main roads you should be fine. Imperial Legion soldiers patrol the roads on horseback and are stationed at most inns; they’ll help you if you feel like you’re in danger. If you run into any trouble, just keep moving as fast as you can until you find a soldier. But if something goes really wrong… here-
It’s a potion of invisibility. Chug it and run. These aren’t cheap, and she’ll expect you to pay for it if you use it, so don’t drink it unless you have to. 
You thank her, but admit you were expecting, like, a weapon. Something to defend yourself with, if you had to. 
She reminds you that these are bandits and monsters you’re talking about, not balls of yarn. What do you think you can do?
Quill-Weave uncomfortably apologizes for the cat burn. She didn’t know those upset you. 

You pack away the invisibility potion in the safest part of your bag and very, very, very carefully leave Quill-Weave’s house. You can’t imagine how you’d feel if you broke something expensive due to your own clumsiness. 
Before you leave, of course, you have a couple more questions. 
Most importantly, you check that the City Guard isn’t after you or anything. I mean, you evidently made quite a scene.
Quill-Weave says not to worry about it. You technically broke a few laws, yeah, but even the guards were all really impressed by what you did. Nobody thought it was physically… possible. The Countess might’ve had something to say about it, but you ran away as soon as she showed up. 
You probably did more damage to your reputation than your legal standing, but you shouldn’t worry about that too much. There’s another female Khajiit who lives in this town, and people keep thinking it was her that pulled the pineapple stunt last night. You guys do look pretty similar. You say that you hope you didn’t hurt the Khajiit’s reputation too badly with this, but Quill-Weave says not to worry about it. This girl’s creative, she’ll find a way to turn it to her advantage. 
Well, time to get a move on you guess. You profusely thank Quill-Weave for all her help and promise you’ll be back as soon as you can with a response from the bookstore owner and a shiny new book in hand. You decide not to tell her about Gharug’s money – that way you can surprise her, and she won’t be disappointed if something goes wrong.
You consider hugging her, but decide against it. She probably doesn’t want to touch you. Actually you’re just too embarrassed because you’ve never hugged anyone before, but you tell yourself it’s because she wouldn’t want to touch you. 
Off you go.
You slink out of town as discreetly as possible. Before you, the Gold Road stretches into the distance across the hilly countryside. You have a long journey ahead of you. But you also have a full stomach, clothes on your back, a good pair of shoes, and someone counting on you. You can do this, you tell yourself. This is the (for real) beginning of your new life in Cyrodiil. 
You are Katia Fucking Managan, and you are going to Kvatch! 
You have no idea what an adventurer poses like but try anyway.
… maybe you’ll try again later.

But yeah. On to adventure Katia! Have fun with it if you can.
Okay okay, you get it. You look like a cat. That doesn’t mean your idea of a heroic tune is humming along with a catfood jingle. That’s just racist. 
You would like some music on the trip though, so you sing along with the first tune that comes to your head. You’re just kind of making it up as you go along, but it feels fitting.
Milestone one! 
You hope Kvatch isn’t much further, your legs are getting tired. 
You walk on for a while.
Pick flowers? You guess wizards or whatever are always mixing up magic potions using flowers and stuff. Maybe if you found some rare plant you could sell it back at town.  
You don’t really have any idea what is a useful potion ingredient and what is just a weed, though.

If four leaf clovers aren’t magic, you don’t know WHAT is! 
Don’t forget mushroom soup, too! Mmm.
The mushrooms prove kind of a hassle to pick, though, since they have these three-leafed things tangled all around their stems. 

You come to the obvious realization about the vines. Fuck.
It’s just poison ivy, though. It’s not, like, real poison. Maybe you can find a stream and wash it off.
Either way, you don’t need any more setbacks on your way to Kvatch. These mushrooms and totally-magical clover you found should give you a little bit of extra spending money, but you still want to make it to the city before nightfall. You throw your plants in your bag and continue along the road.
Hours pass. You encounter absolutely no water sources. Not only is this poison ivy starting to act up, but you’re getting kind of thirsty. According to the map, you’ve still got a ways to go until you reach Kvatch.
Suddenly, a familiar voice calls after you. 

Huh, that… actually makes a lot of sense.
You’re a little disappointed; you kind of liked to think this thing was increasing your luck by some minuscule-yet-significant amount. I mean, at least until you sold it. But who would want a dumb mutant clover that doesn’t do anything special?
Hey Cornmuffin, fancy seeing you out here on this fine piece of trail.
You politely greet Gharug back. You’re on the road to Kvatch, right? You thought he had somewhere else to be.
He explains that earlier today he learned he had to head toward Kvatch for a business trip. It turned out there was an important meeting he had to get to, to follow through on one of his many amazing investments. It sounds as though his business is going to be very successful.
Oh, I’m a professional highwayman. 
Gharug says he’ll need that five gold back, along with anything the lizard-lass gave you. He’s got to get his rob on, if you know what he’s saying. 
(He’s saying he’s robbing you)

Then, quickly reach for the potion and drink it while he is distracted.
Okay but you’re KIND OF flipping out here. This guy is waving a fucking SWORD in your face and acting like you’re supposed to be all calm and businesswomanly about this and to make matters worse you’re about to try to outsmart him or something. 
You tell him okay, you are reaching into your bag to get the money. The money that you’re going to give to him. You put on your best kitten-eyes, trying to either distract him from your potion or make him feel sympathy. Heck, you’re kind of hoping for about any effect at all here.
Gharug doesn’t seem all that fazed by it. What’s that sticking out of your bag? Is that a potion of invisibility? Those are expensive. They also make you so hard to see.
Luckily, he always keeps a magic scroll of Detect Life packed between his angular, rock-hard abs. Do you know how handy this is when someone tries to hide? It’s incredibly handy. That’s the answer.
So let’s not start bringing our magic crap into this, Apricot.

You don’t exactly operate well under pressure. In a spur-of-the-moment decision, you try to execute every fallback plan at once.
Suffice to say, none of them are very effective.
Gharug is getting tired of this though. He has other meetings to get to. He tells you to get down on the ground or else he’ll just lop your head off and call it a day.

While you are unable to decode the book, Quill-Weave knows how to. You used to be a crook too afterall. You were planning on helping Quill-Weave get the book only to betray her once she had finished decoding it. So, it would really be cool if Gahrug didn’t kill you and all.
Your mind is filled with cunning plans and heroic maneuvers. You know there has to be some way to get out of this with your life intact. Maybe you could run or hide or trick him or fight him or… or..
You’re not a hero. You’re just a scared, friendless nobody who doesn’t want to bleed to death on the side of a road. You’re being threatened by someone twice your size who, last night, threw a sword into a wall so hard you couldn’t get it back out.  
You’re sorry, you just can’t do this. 
Gharug commends your choice. If everyone was as smart as you, he would almost never have to get his kill on. He proceeds to rifle through your belongings for anything of value. 
You ask him why he even gave you the money if he was just going to take it back. Experience has taught him that this is a lot easier if victims trust him on their second encounter. And it worked well this time: he got at least a 600% return on his initial investment! He’s kind of a stickler for bookkeeping, he explains; he’ll even write you a receipt if you want. 
After a few minutes, his assessment of your inventory is complete. At your request, he leaves the letter and book. You consider spinning an elaborate tale about how the book is actually a secret treasure map only you know how to translate, but it has your map, lockpick, and glass shard inside and you don’t really want him to find out about them. At this point, you’re cutting your losses and trying to keep whatever you can. 
Gharug notices something else beneath the blanket. What’s this?
Four leaf clover!!!
It’s his lucky day. Moreso than usual, even.
Anyway, pleasure conducting business with you, Sweetcakes. This gap in the patrol doesn’t last all day, though, so he’s got to get his flee on, if you know what he’s saying. He’s saying he’s leaving. Take care, and good luck earning some more money. 
And as fast as he showed up, Gharug is gone.
You feel awful. While you are glad you survived, a nagging voice in the back of your head insists that maybe you could’ve ran. Maybe you could’ve taken him in a fight. Maybe if you weren’t such a worthless coward who can’t do anything right, none of this would’ve happened. Why didn’t you tell Quill-Weave about Gharug’s money? She would’ve known Fixes-Homes is a stupid fake name. You’re an idiot. Your life’s probably not even worth the 30 septims you just lost. 
And to make matters worse, that clover is totally going to make Gharug find more clovers or something until he has all the luck.

You’re right. 
The best thing you can do right now is just keep pressing forward. If nothing else, you’ll be able to say that you at least tried. You still have Quill-Weave’s letter, so you can at least do that for her. You’re going to give this your all, even if it means finding out your all is not that much. You promise. 
You pack the letter safely away in the book and tuck the book back into your bag. 
Do we really need to go through this again?
Frankly, you’d love to know how to do magic stuff. You’ve never told this to anyone, but you actually think wizards are about the coolest thing ever. It’s not just the sparkles and fireballs, it’s that whole idea of making something happen with their mind. They want something to happen and it just does. That never happens for you, ever. It’s like the more you want something, the less likely it is to happen. 
And sometimes that makes you really sad. 
This receipt is incredibly silly.
You take it along anyway. Maybe you’ll be able to get a tax rebate or something. I mean, if you ever have an income. 
You keep telling yourself that, but deep down you know it’s not true. You thought you’d have a chance to earn money in the last town, and look how that turned out: you just kept screwing up. Today looks like it’s headed along that same path. 
Anyway, nobody wants your help. You’re not good at anything – at least anything people care about. You try not to think about it too hard, but you know Quill-Weave just gave you this job out of pity. 
God you sound mopey. Time to shut off the Feelings Tap and focus on the task at hand. You’re still pretty thirsty and a ways from Kvatch, so it’d be nice if you could find a well or something. Or a discarded bottle of booze. That would be really nice too.
Hell, or you could find a pile of discarded money. That would solve problems. 
There’s some stuff over there, a little ways off the road.

KATIA IS SO CONFLICTED.
Democracy isn’t working here. Time to look at the arguments for and against and see which can personally appeal to you more.

Exactly how many times are you going to have to explain this? 
And woah, hey, that’s just mean. 
Let’s get down to business though.
The best course of action to complete that task:
Don’t dawdle, get the prescribed task you currently have done before trying to do a bunch of other things. You may find treasure. You may break your neck in a pit trap or get devoured by giant rats. Alternatively, you will receive some compensation (even if it’s just trust/rapport) for completing Quill-Weave’s task, with a significantly reduced risk of not dying.
You’re right. 
There’s no telling what kind of danger lies among those ruins. Sure, you may find something of value, but you may also get eviscerated by a monster. You’re not an  experienced traveler; should danger arise, you have no experience in defending yourself. If you ran into trouble, it would be big trouble. You were told it was safest to stay on the path. 
You’ve had setbacks, sure, but you still have Quill-Weave’s letter. You lost her potion and you lost her money, but you can still deliver this letter and return with the response. You may have to sleep on the cold streets of Kvatch, but you can do it. 
You understand that. 
You know you’re not going to advance much from doing this, but it will be a small start. It will be one person you haven’t completely failed.  
And you know that she’ll still be disappointed in you. She gave you a simple job out of pity, and you’re going to come back in more debt than when you left. When you kept Gharug’s money a secret, you were hoping you could surprise her. Show her that not only could you do everything she asked, but you could do more. You could be something special. Someone special, who goes above and beyond. But now it’s just like Lelles’ said: your “best” is slightly worse than everyone else’s “average”. And it hurts, trudging through the job knowing that your only goal is to minimize the inevitable disappointment. 
Maybe you’ll have some opportunities to get money in Kvatch. More of the same: jobs you don’t have the skills to accomplish, given to you by people who know you’re worthless. More people to disappoint, uncomfortably agreeing to pay you one coin for your failed efforts. Here you’re nothing more than a homeless slut begging for work. You should’ve just stayed back in Hammerfell as that trashy Khajiit whose own family didn’t even believe in her. At least there, you had a home. At least there, they were used to you letting them down. 
You don’t know if you’d find anything valuable in those ruins. Maybe you’d find a treasure that would solve all your problems; enough to let you return triumphantly to Quill-Weave with a response letter, new book, and a contractor to fix her windows. Maybe you’d find a monster that’d make Gharug look like a lightweight. You know with every ounce of your being that you should take that step toward Kvatch. But you also know that, should you turn back to those ruins, there’s one thing you are guaranteed to find:    
Hope.
Maybe only for a fleeting moment, until you find them empty or get devoured by a monster. But for that one moment, you know there is a chance you could fix everything. A chance for you to do more than mitigate damages to an already failed quest. You could do something you’ve never done before; something you’ve never failed at. Your whole body feels heavy as you begin to walk toward Kvatch.
… but when you take that experimental step backwards toward the mysterious ruins, toward the unknown, you feel light as a feather.
One hour. 
You’re going to play this safe, plan ahead, take precautions, and check them out. And then in one hour, you’re going to continue to Kvatch.

Latent pyrokinesis? Hidden powers? Cripes.
Listen, if you had something like that, you would’ve figured it out by now. It’s not like you’ve never met a wizard, or have never read a book about how some down-to-earth peasant suddenly discovered their latent mystical abilities. When you were younger you even went through a phase where you really really tried to learn how to use magic.
But it just didn’t happen. Even the wizards didn’t sense any significant amount of Magicka in you. So you looked at everything you had seen in wizards and everything you had seen in yourself and concluded that the difference was beards. The only other explanation you can think of is that there’s just something wrong with you. So beards it is, and you try not to think about the alternative too hard.
Seriously now, you’re quite sure those fires aren’t magic. They’re just… a thing. That’s probably not your fault. Anyone with half a mind could tell that.
You have more pressing matters to deal with at the moment.

Crack the tip of the stick, so you can get to halves between which you can insert a shard (or two, three shards, who cares!) of your glass, just like a machete. To turn it more sturdy, wrap the shard arround the pole with a vine or one of the laces of your outfit – there, you have a deadly weapon, not very difficult to use, just wave it arround and you’ll eventually hit something or someone pretty bad, cuts, bruises, that kind of stuff.
SECOND: Gather some rocks, or pieces of debry to throw – this could be vital when it comes to making swift runs for your life: with this you can distract your opponent long enough to disappear… Can… you do that?… o_õ

Well, it’s obviously a sparkly-shiny-magic-thing. You don’t know too much about ancient cultures, but you can tell from the pretentious, swirly architecture that these ruins were built by some kind of elf. They also look pretty damn ancient. This fixture seems just as old as the rest of the ruins, yet a steady stream of misty blue flame continues to gush forth from this opening. It’s actually quite pretty.
You’re not sure if you are supposed to touch it. 
You’re not sure if you were supposed to have touched it.
Yeah, you’re on a time limit here. You pat your fur flat again and head down the hill to inspect the old stone door.
You quickly discover your machete is a cheap piece of shit. To be honest you’re not even sure it’s a machete. Whatever it is, it can’t cut these damn vines. You settle for just pushing them aside. 

Ooh, right! You turn around to quickly nab those-
AAAAAAAAH fuck fuck fuck fuck
Yeah, how about no. 
You stuff your painfully-acquired clovers into your collar and VERY CAREFULLY descend into the ruins, keeping your eyes peeled for traps. You’re not going to screw this up; your life could be on the line here. 
Anyway, tripping on stairs? You’re not that much of a klutz. And with these two clovers, you’re far too lucky to fall down like that!
It depends how you define “crypt”.
Like, for this guy? It’s totally a crypt.
You hope it doesn’t end up a crypt for you too. 
You kind of wish you thought of that before leaving Quill-Weave’s house. Without a writing implement, you’ll just have to remember your way back to the surface. 
The air down here is thick and muggy. You can’t even see sunlight anymore. A little voice in the back of your head is reminding you what a horribly bad idea this is, but you do your best to silence it. This is your chance to make things better, you remind yourself. 

Well, this looks like a scorch mark on the wall. 
And yeah, this seems to be dried blood on the floor. 
Aaaaand this looks like poop next to it. There’s probably some way to tell how long ago this was left here, but you’re no poopologist. 
Okay, this isn’t working so well. Time for Plan B. 
Whoops.
You can’t reach it. You kind of figured something like this would happen. At least bad luck is predictable. 
You carefully slip through the metal gate into the next room.
This must be the main hall. This place is a lot bigger than you expected. You remind yourself of your goal: get in, find something valuable, and get out. Quick and quiet. You just hope you’re alone in here. 
You have to remain brave! You are Katia Managan! You are a master of stealth… and far from unarmed.
This is the best idea.

Yeah, this 300-pound axe idea doesn’t seem as good as it did thirty seconds ago. You don’t think you can disconnect the shaft, though. I mean, you only got it down in the first place by jumping up and down on the thing until it fell off its hinge.
Actually, you think you may have sprained your ankle a little doing that. But you got off way easier than the skeleton did.
You drag your axe up the steps and check out the stone slab in the middle of the room. A few metal boxes are sitting on it, but both are empty. It’s pretty clear you’re not the first person to ransack these ruins.
From your vantage point, you peer down the two adjacent hallways. Both of them bend to the side before you can see their end. Luckily, these giant ears aren’t just for show…

I demand that Katia get a Relicanth somehow.
Keep in mind you are in near-complete darkness.  You may as well be invisible.  Just don’t stand out in the open and nothing will notice you so long as you remain quiet.  So right now, you need to sneak.  Approach the noise while making no sound yourself.
That “axe”?  Not quiet.  Ditch it.  This is a sneaking mission.
Is that… flapping? It sounds bigger than a bat. You’re not sure if it’s dangerous or not, but uneasily conclude that the worst thing you can do right now is turn your back and let it sneak up on you. 
You’ll have to investigate.
Whatever it is, you don’t want it knowing you’re here. You abandon your noisy 300-pound-axe and slowly creep over to the source of the noise. 
You ready your makeshift shield and piece-of-shit machete. You don’t know if these things will hold up in an actual fight, but holding them makes you feel a bit less defenseless. 
Weird, you don’t hear the sound anymore. You cautiously enter the hallway, keeping your eyes on the ceiling.
 No sight of the mysterious winged creatures. The ancient stonework is striped with large, deep cracks. Not only does this make you question the structural stability of this place, but there’s pretty much a 100% chance that something is hiding up there and going to spring out when you least expect it. 
Or maybe you scared the creatures away? That would be nice. You nervously continue onward to the end of the hallway. 
What the hell is going on here?

Done.
You politely greet the ghost and remark on his gruesome death. You’re not really sure the proper way to respectfully speak to a ghost, so you nervously offer to deliver any final messages to the surface if he wants. You’re very sorry about his accident. 
Save your concern, the ghost commands, he’s been dead for centuries. He was that mer’s guardian ancestor, before the guy accidentally pulled a pillar onto himself. The ghost has no more descendants left to guard, so figures he’ll just loiter around here for a while. You know, tell any explorers about how his dumbass grandson died while trying to climb a nine-foot pillar. Feel free to loot the corpse. 
You are more than happy to oblige. Luck seems to finally be working in your favor (took it long enough!). You thank the ghost profusely.  
It’s fine, he says. He can think of no more fitting ending to his bloodline’s legacy than being robbed blind by a mangy Khajiit whore. It wouldn’t be the first time it happened to his grandson. Just take that awful man-purse off the corpse as well, in case someone respectable comes down here and sees the body. There’s a pretty strong personality-enhancing potion in there, the ghost explains…
… His grandson was probably going to use it to get a better price when selling those five bottles of wine. You’d be surprised how much collectors will pay for these old vintages. 
Then again, you probably already know this stuff. Khajiit or not, he assumes you are an experienced adventurer given that you got past all those imps unharmed. All the traps in this place have been set off ages ago, but most people who wander down here still get electrocuted, mauled, and disemboweled before they even make it down the stairs. Sometimes someone gets lucky and comes in while the swarms are out, but that never lasts more than a few minutes.
You hear that? Sounds like some are  returning. He looks forward to seeing you in action!
Okay, you tell yourself, don’t panic. There are no light sources remaining in this hallway. The imps probably can’t even see you in the dark. 
Hey! Cat jokes are very hurtf-
OH MY GODS WHAT DID YOU DOOOO? WHAT DID YOU DOOOOOOOO?

OH GODS OH GODS YOU’RE MAKING IT WORSE! NO NO NO NO
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

no no no UNF
The imp flaps down and knocks you off your feet. You can hear more wings fluttering in the distance.
Well. It looks like you’re going to die in an ancient ruin. This isn’t really how you wanted to go. I mean, you didn’t really want to die to begin with, but of all the ways you COULD die this is like, #6 on your list at least.
You guess all you can do at this point is pray. You’re not exactly sure if you should be praying to the 8 or 9 Cyrodillic gods, or the like 13 Khajiit ones… or all 22? Some of those might actually be repeats, you’re not sure. Maybe you can just pray without a specific god in mind? But that might mean your prayers are lost and just go nowhere. Or maybe all prayers are lost and go nowhere. That would explain a lot of things.
Religion is horribly confusing. You swear, if you were a god you’d at least try to make sense.
In fact, fuck this bullshit. You’ve been ridiculed, robbed, and treated like an animal. You don’t deserve to die like this, at least not now when you are so close to turning your life around. All you have to do is get these bottles to Kvatch and shit will be better. People will believe in you. And like hell you’re going to let some swarm of ugly winged things get in your way.
Whatever that little flappy bastard thinks he can do – whatever he thinks he has over you, YOU’RE about to show him otherwise.
You are now the imp.
You are an imp. Your level of cognition is roughly equal to that of a dog. Your hobbies include flying, sleeping, and shooting explosive blasts of lightning at innocent people. Of these three hobbies, shooting lightning at people is your favorite. You love the part where they stop moving.
Oh hey it’s a people.
You’re gonna shoot lightning at her until she dies.

Unfortunately, your animalistic mind is far too simple to understand that the ruins are shaking because of the pillar you just exploded. To you, the two events are unrelated. The ruins are just shaking. Maybe if you wait a bit they’ll stop.
You can no longer be the imp because the imp is dead.
You are now the Khajiit again. 
And things are starting to look a bit better for you. You toss the book containing Quill-Weave’s letter into your new satchel, make sure the satchel is secured, and take off. All in all, this is a pretty nice turn of events. You’ve secured a small fortune in alcoholic beverages, found a bit of excitement, successfully pulled off the scary-eye-thing, and might have discovered latent pyrokinetic powers. Not to mention you’re totally going to be able to finish everything Quill-Weave wanted you to do in Kvatch and then some. 
I mean, assuming you get out alive. But you’re trying not to think too hard about that. Maybe that’s the secret. Maybe you just have to go… a little crazy, and everything you do will turn to gold. 
You can hear the rooms behind you collapsing in on themselves. No time to turn and look; slowing down could mean your death. 
But you’re almost there. Nothing can stop you now. You’re Katia Fucking Managan, and everything you fucked up today, you’re about to make better!

Yeah… you wish you had asked the ghost to come along.
You could really use a friend to talk to. Right now you’re just sort of holding back tears by pretending the last 30 seconds didn’t happen and you’re still running up those stairs. 

Suddenly, the Ancestor Guardian pops up from the ground! He heard you were in need of a friend, and a protector. And all of the hugs. 
The two of you take off for a wacky buddy adventure together! You will no doubt face many perils on your journeys, but it doesn’t matter because you’ve got eachother’s backs! Oh the crazy antics you guys get into. 
Of course none of that actually happens. You pretend it’s real for a little while, imagining what it’s like to actually have real friends who care about you. But the harder you try to pretend, the more it hurts to remember that you’re all alone out here in the middle of nowhere. That you just screwed up everything again with one little mistake. You try not to think about it, to just keep moving forward, but you can’t make the thoughts go away. It feels terrible. 
Maybe if you lapped up some of that magic potion it would give you a bit of confidence? What does confidence even mean, forgetting all the stuff you messed up? You could lick up some of that wine for the same effect. But… no, you’re not ready to do that, no matter how much you want to right now. Time to focus on other things. 
You’ll be okay. You’ve had worse. It even makes it a bit easier to forget about the poison ivy rash. 
The envelope got stained. You peek inside to make sure the contents are still legible.
This looks alright. You tuck it back in the envelope without reading any of it, since you really shouldn’t have opened it to begin with. But at least it’s fine. That’s one thing going your way, you guess. You’re still feeling pretty awful about everything, though.
You… guess? It’s an upgrade over your bindle, anyway. In fact, yeah, you’ll just pretend this satchel was what you were after all alo-
You hate everything about yourself.

And none of it mattered, did it NitroGlyde? Every time you almost did something good, it went sour. Every time you got close, it got further. Maybe you were never close to begin with. Maybe you were just too dumb to realize how hopeless you were from the very moment you set foot here. 
You’re not a hero. You’re not a productive citizen. You’re not even a real human being.
Maybe you just finally have to accept that your “best” is worse than everyone else’s “average”. Then you could at least stop thinking you have a chance, and stop making other people believe in you. In the end, nothing hurts more than being wrong. 
You caught this bottle before it spilled all the way.

You understand that this is the wrong thing to do. People in your position are supposed to be strong and persevere; throw down their bottles and keep on trucking through whatever hurdles wind up in their path. You understand that every fable of redemption says you can make a life-changing choice right here and keep on bounding toward Kvatch. You understand all this, you really do.
But you just don’t think you have that in you. Not everyone can be a hero like in the stories. Every failure you’re supposed to bravely shrug off instead grips your heart in a cold embrace that just makes you want to curl up in a ball and never move again. You want to change, you really do, but you’ve come to accept that it can’t be done. Some things are just a part of people and they never go away no matter how hard that person tries to fix it. 
It just happens that everything about you is a problem. And all you can do about it is keep being you. 
The question strikes a nerve.
You know your real name, yet it feels foreign to you. You try to say it out loud, but you can’t. 
You’re Katia Managan. It’s an identity you made up two days ago, but it already feels like… you. 
For some reason, you’re just not ready to give the name up. Maybe you’re not too different from who you were before, but that doesn’t mean you’re the same person. Sure, you’ve tried to change in the past, tried to turn your life around, but you’ve never been Katia Managan. Katia Managan has been a screwup for two days, not two decades. Katia Managan still has a chance. 
You don’t expect anyone to understand what it means for you to be Katia Managan. It changes everything. When you left home and came to Cyrodiil, it wasn’t just the epilogue to a long, sad story. It was the prequel to something undefined. It was a new story, too young for anyone to predict the ending. Sure, maybe the protagonist isn’t very skilled and has a drinking problem, but she’s only been around for two days. Who knows what will happen. 
You don’t know if you think you can change. You don’t really know what you think at all. Maybe that’s why you drink: it makes things simpler. 
You’re sorry, but you have to do this. This is a choice you are making as Katia Managan and no one else. You know it’s not a good idea, and that you might very well die. You just don’t care. At least you think you don’t. You don’t even know anymore. You’re a mess.
You don’t know how this is going to end, but that’s still better than knowing there awaits a sad ending.
Bottoms up. See you again soon, you think you hope.
Well, you’re alive. 

No, not for the drinking. For keeping the name Katia. It tells me one thing, you still have hope. At your at the time worst moment of despair in a not so long while you still had hope you can pull through even if you weren’t fully feeling it. That’s something to work with. You haven’t given up. We can’t climb out the proverbial hole until we hit the bottom any way so perhaps that was the bottom and we’ve begun climbing!
Thanks. You guess it’s kind of nice to believe that things can still be okay. You appreciate the sentiment, anyway.

When I first looked at you, I saw hope, i thought you really wanted to climb out of your previous life and change. I thought you could do it, I trusted in you and had faith.

Surrender. oidip wrote: Just look at you. You had to do one thing, you had to deliver a letter.
Even the lowest rung of society can do that and you couldn’t. Don’t think you can turn your life around.
Also valid ways of looking at this, yeah. You have some serious thinking to do about your life, and you’re not looking forward to it. Luckily, you have more pressing issues to deal with right now.
Like figuring out what the hell happened here.

All of your stuff is gone. 
The cuts on your hand have scabbed over but not healed much beyond that, implying only about a night has passed since you got them. The poison ivy rash on your wrist has gotten a bit worse, too.  
Something about this method of checking the passage of time feels incredibly futuristic to you, but you’re not sure why. 
You already said all your stuff is-
No comment. 
You attempt to strike up a conversation with the skeleton, but he appears to be nothing more than a simple automaton whose only function is to clean this room. He dutifully goes about his work while completely disregarding you. If you want answers, you’re going to have to find them yourself. 
Clearly, that is a Pendant of Silence!
Yeah, just kidding, it’s a ball gag. You’re just gonna leave it there for now, since you don’t have anything to carry it in and it might be kind of embarrassing to be caught walking around with bondage gear.   
No pineapple this time, thankfully.
You found that fishbowl full of peas, though. 
It’s a box of Nord chocolates! This is a rather extravagant gift. I mean, for you anyway. There’s a note and bottle next to it.
“Dear Katia,
Thank you for the good night! Us necromancers don’t get much ‘live action’ if you know what I mean, so I’ll definitely be the talk of the crypts! Though you may want to steer clear of Garlas Agea in the future, since my comrades tend to be a jealous flock and there is a small chance they may kill you on sight. I must say, though, their jealousy is warranted! Intercourse with you was very enjoyable and the fake underwear made it even hotter. 
I apologize that I could not bid you farewell in person, but the guards in this city have some questions about how I acquired several of those skulls – questions to which I lack legally satisfactory answers. Hopefully some confections I purchased next door will suffice in the place of a true ‘goodbye’. I also mixed a potion of Cure Disease and left it on the dresser. While I don’t wish to imply anything negative about myself or my kinsmen, I will say that you’ll probably want to drink that as soon as possible.
Thanks for finding me!
-D
P.S.: Your argonian friend seemed rather upset when she came home this morning. I offered to help clean up the mess we made, but she still wants to talk to you when you wake up.”

Yeah, how about fuck you. There are things in life that are more important than money, and one of them is Not Having Zombie AIDS. Or whatever.
It tastes like pie crust and feet. Not so bad that you need to chase it down with a chocolate, though. You want to hang onto those in case you can sell them later. 
There’s just the pants she bought for Gharug. Well, and her note reminding her to buy more clothes.  
Excuse me, but there’s certain things you have set out to change in your new life.
Anyway, you’ve been down that road. You did alright back home. I mean, you weren’t technically a prostitute, but you certainly got around. Nabbing breakfast on your way out was enough to keep you fed, other people’s beds were a fine place to sleep, and if times ever got particularly tough you had a family you could mooch off of. It was an existence. 
But it just wasn’t a satisfying life. You always wanted something more, like an occupation you didn’t have to be ashamed of, or a friend you didn’t have to turn tricks for. Maybe you just wanted dignity.
Like, look at you right now. The only other person in this house is Quill-Weave, who has already seen you naked and is also female. And you’re wearing pants anyway. 
That’s because you have DIGNITY.
A little bit anyway.
Speaking of Quill-Weave…
Well, you guess the best you can do is apologize profusely, take the full blame for your miserable failure, not ask for a second chance, and get out of her life forever. 
Or try to sneak out the door. You’d do the window but you’re kind of apprehensive to jump out the second-story window lined with broken glass.

Whew, at least it looks like you guys didn’t wreck her hallw-
FUCK
Okay, this cat pun thing is getting out of hand. You’ve got to find someone who can help you with this. 
You’re right, though. Sneaking out would just be cowardly after everything she’s done for you. Time to do this. 
You find her in the kitchen. You totally could’ve snuck out without any problems if you had tried. 
Too late now, anyway. 
Yeah…
Hey, you say.
Hey, she says back.
You kind of messed up, you explain. In fact you messed up pretty damn hard. You’re really sorry and you understand that she’s probably really mad at you. If she wants, you’ll just leave right now and never come back. You’d understand.
Quill-Weave tells you she is mad, yes. But she also wants to know what happened. 
You divulge the whole story. You tell her about how Gharug gave you money to hire a repair man and you didn’t tell her because you wanted it to be a surprise, and how it turned out to be a trick and Gharug threatened to kill you and took all your stuff. You were really sad and cried a little but you kept going toward Kvatch, because you didn’t want to let anyone down more than you had to, but then you saw some ruins and thought maybe you could find something valuable in there so you could still buy the new book. And you did find something valuable, but then there were also monsters and you accidentally set some stuff on fire and the place collapsed and you broke everything you found and in the end you were so sad and confused that all you could think to do was drink. 
You don’t know what happened after that but it evidently involved having drunken sex with a necromancer and maybe a skeleton. Somewhere in there you even lost the nice clothes she bought you. 
It was all your fault, and you’re sorry. You should’ve told her about the repair man, or followed her advice and stayed on the road. Everything that went wrong was because you kept trying to do a good job and failing. Maybe you’re just worthless.
Quill-Weave says she is still disappointed in you. You made mistakes that could have been avoided if you had played your cards better, and you gave up when things got too hard. But you’re not worthless. 
You have aspirations. You really want to make your life into something better. Something significant. You might not be worth much now, but you’re also not satisfied with who you are. 
Sure, you’ve done nothing but screw up, but your intentions were good. Everything you did was because you wanted to help make things better. You failed, but at least you tried and that damn well counts for something.
You ask if this means she’ll give you a second chance. Maybe you can still get that letter to Kvatch. You’ll be carefuller this time. You can prove to her that you can be different. 
Quill-Weave admits she is apprehensive. She isn’t just giving you work out of pity. She really needs things done, and she really wants you to repay her for the damaged room. While she recognizes you are enthusiastic to help, you still haven’t shown much success. Employing you is risky.  
She has to think about this. It’s not a decision that can be made on a whim. Maybe you could just… come back a little later, after she’s had time to think about it? If you can find someone in town who is willing to employ you instead, that would probably be better. Feel free to borrow the sheet until she has a chance to get you a proper shirt. 
You ask if she forgives you. She’s the closest thing you have to a friend, you explain. And you really need a friend right now. 
She has to think about it.
You try your best to smile as you offer her the chocolates the necromancer gave you. 
This certainly puts you closer to being forgiven, she says, but she still needs time to deliberate. Maybe reconvene in an hour or two? You agree, and say a quick goodbye.
You guess that went better than you were expecting. She doesn’t hate you, but thinking about how much you let her down still puts a knot in your stomach. At least what’s done is done; you’ve confronted her and told the truth about everything. You just wish you could feel better about it. 
Well okay this actually makes you feel a little better. You look ridiculous, though.

Okay, have you ever actually SEEN a Cyrodilic rat?
You saw one once at a travelling circus. They had it fighting an alligator. 
The rat lost, but it was still pretty terrifying. Basically, if someone is willing to hire trained fighters to kill something, it’s something untrained people should avoid.
… actually, maybe they were just feeding that alligator. You were like six when you saw it. But your point about hiring trained fighters stands. 
Yeah, you’re fond of this cape but you should probably make some effort to actually cover your breasts.
How’s this?

Eee, thanks! Of course Quill-Weave will probably want her bedsheet back eventually.
Cyrodiil is the country, not the town. But yeah, maybe it’s time for a break.
You find a nice little spot and lounge around for about twenty minutes. Take some time to just meditate on your own thoughts. 
Hopefully you’ll be able to find some more work in town. Even if they didn’t know of any jobs at the docks, maybe someone else will have a better idea? Maybe some manual labor; something you absolutely can’t mess up. If you absolutely have to head out of town again it might also benefit you to find a travelling partner. A friend willing to watch your back. Of course, to get that you actually have to make some friends. You keep hoping someone will talk to you, but they mostly avoid getting near you or whisper things to their friends and children when you come into view. 
Right now though, you have a bigger issue you need to tackle: spontaneous combustion.
You guess you have magic powers or something? You can’t help but feel that your life might have been different if this had happened sooner. Maybe you could have built it into a talent, apprenticed under one of the few wizards in Hammerfell, and had your life go down an entirely different path. You wish you knew why this is only happening now, when it’s too late to matter. 
Well, only one way to find out. 
Yamtaggler wrote: >Go find some mages to ask about these sick fires. That seems like it should be a priority. GeneralMister wrote: >Visit the mage guild Katia 
It takes you a little while to find the local Mages Guild. You are nervous out of your mind as you walk down the steps into the building. It’s been a decade since you even saw a wizard, and you’re not really sure what to expect. In Hammerfell there were some pretty weird stereotypes about wizards, but you’re sure they aren’t all true.
You are greeted enthusiastically.
Zahrasha! This is certainly a surprise! What are you doing all the way down here in – oh dear, you’re some other random female Khajiit aren’t you? Well this is certainly awkward! What is it you need?

NathanGraves wrote: >Imitate their weird pose to show them you come in peace Aelyrin wrote: He must be talking about that girl Quill-weave had mentioned.
See if we can get some information about her.
Zahrasha? You heard there was someone in town who looked kind of like you. Does she come by here?
Oh, no, the wizard explains. Zahrasha is just one of his Khajiit friends from up at the university. You look a lot like her. Not because all Khajiit look the same or anything! That would be incredibly racist and inappropriate.
That’s okay, you say, it’s probably just the lighting. Anyway, I’m Katia. I recently acquired some unusual… magic problems. Whenever I get offended by a cat joke, even one I thought up myself, stuff catches on fire –

– kind of like that.
You dig uncomfortably into your past and tell the wizard everything. You explain that you’ve never been able to use magic, despite trying your hardest to learn how when you were younger. When you started to get really frustrated, your parents even had you tested by some wizards. They said you’d never be able to use magic, but they didn’t know why. One of them suggested it might be a treatable disease called “astral vapors”, but even the most expensive medicines didn’t help you. You’ve kind of tried to forget about that time in your life. 
Sometimes fires would start around you, but you figured it was caused by someone or something else. But then yesterday it started getting… worse. The fires got bigger, and yesterday you almost got killed because of it. You guess the fires got worse after you touched this sparkly blue thing you found in some ruins? It was kind of a dumb, impulsive move on your part, and you promise you won’t touch mysterious magic things in the future. 
The wizard strokes his lack-of-beard thoughtfully. He says it is quite the puzzling predicament, but he has a theory. He needs to know when you were born. You give him your full birthday: 8th of Sun’s Dusk, 413.
He tells you to wait here; he has to check the library for a book. He also wants to see if his amulet collection is still here. If he’s right, he thinks you’ll like what he has to say. Just give him a few minutes. 
With the wizard out of the room, you let your arms down to rest for a bit. You choke out a nervous laugh and tell the elf woman that just yesterday, you were still genuinely convinced that people needed a long beard to use magic. She tells you that’s very silly. Wizards work with open flames all the time; for a magic user to even consider having facial hair, he’d have to be… mad! Frankly, she wouldn’t even use magic if she had fur. Not to be racist or anything. You tell her it’s okay, you understand. 
You confess that you are also a bit short on cash, and looking for a way to get some spare spending money. Or eating money. You’d be very interested if the guild needs anyone to run errands, or collect plants in the fields outside of town. 
She says that she can’t think of anything they need right now. They’ve mostly been doing research and the occasional healing job that the chapel can’t handle. The roads are relatively safe as of late, making ingredient collection a rather enjoyable and scenic activity. The coast in particular is beautiful at this time of year. Occasionally other people do stop by the guildhall looking to get more unusual ingredients, of course.  
Ah, how opportune! There’s Matt. He’s a chef who specializes in traditional Argonian cuisine, which she understands is spiced with poisons that would be lethal to most species. He stops by every once in a while to buy more ingredients. Hi Matt! Don’t forget to wipe the marinara sauce off that kitchen knife. 
What a nice boy. Hannibal says we have to triple our prices for some reason when selling to Matt, so maybe he’d be willing to buy ingredients from you if you’re interested? 
You tell her that’s okay, you think you will find someone else to work for. She says that’s fine, it’s your choice. Anything else she can help you with while you wait?

WHO IS THIS “MATT” OF WHICH YOU SPEAK?
There is nobody in here but you, the elf, and the wizard.
You continue to chat with the elf lady while you wait for the wizard to return.
You lie and say that you already have some folks lined up who are willing to purchase ingredients from you. However, you have trouble recognizing which plants are worth the most. You are wondering if she has any good resources on alchemy you could borrow. 
She replies that she knows a bit about alchemy herself. For her standard 50 gold/hour training fee, she’d be willing to give you some basic lessons in identifying useful ingredients. You tell her that you can’t spare that kind of money right now, but she refuses to budge on the price. She just can’t spare the time without compensation. She has too many important experiments going on right now. 
Like this thing!
It goes back and forth!
Before you have much time to admire the Swingy Ball Thing, the wizard returns and asks you to come with him. He found exactly what he was looking for. You uneasily follow him into the next room, unsure what to expect. 
First things first, he wants to lend you an old trinket of his. Put this on.
It’s an Amulet of Silence, he explains. As in, an actual enchanted amulet, not the slang term for a ball gag. Not that I’m saying you’d be familiar with BDSM jargon just because you’re a Khajiit! That would be an incredibly racist thing to imply. 
It should solve your fire problem. You can still speak while wearing the amulet, but you won’t be able to use magic until you take it off. Needless to say, it’s been involved in quite a few practical jokes. Most of which accidentally ended in the joke-victim getting killed. 
In fact, forget lending, maybe it’s best if you just keep the amulet. It’d be good to get some new fingerprints on it.
You thank the wizard for his gift, but confess that you were hoping to learn why this was happening to you, not just suppress it. 
That’s why he needed your birth date, he explains. See, sometimes when magic talent first manifests in a person, there is some… spell discharge, before they learn to control it. Usually if this was going to happen it would have happened when you were a child, which made your case rather unusual. But then he figured it out: you’re an Atronach.
You ask him what he means, because you’ve got no idea.
You were born under a constellation called the Atronach, or Golem. The stars often have some small impact on peoples’ lives, but none so great as being born under the Atronach. 
You handle magicka differently than most people. While their bodies produce magicka, yours absorbs it. In the past when you were unable to use magic, it was probably simply because your reservoir was depleted. When you touched that “blue sparkly thing”, which he suspects was an ancient Ayleid magicka well, it fully charged you up for what was probably the first time in your entire life. 
Judging from your display in the lobby, you’re perfectly healthy in terms of magic ability. Many people would say that because of your birthsign, you’re destined to become a powerful mage.
This is a lot for you to take in. You are more than a little distraught that your life might have gone down an entirely different path if you had learned about your birthsign earlier. Like, if you hadn’t avoided reading about astrology due to being irrationally afraid of the Lord constellation. 
You’re just not sure what to do about this now. Part of you feels like it’s too late in your life to simply start learning magic, especially when you can’t afford any kind of training. But at least you know there’s nothing really wrong with you like you once believed. 
The wizard says that what you do now is up to you. Not to be racist, but he admits that magic can be difficult for Khajiit, especially getting a late start like you are. It’s not impossible, though. In fact, that close Khajiit friend he mentioned, Zahrasha, was just a bit younger than you when she started! She has rapidly progressed to one of the most respected positions at the University. He thinks you’d get along with her really well; if you ever end up enrolling, the two of you would probably become best friends upon your first formal meeting.
You say that sounds very nice. You always wanted a Khajiit friend – no racism intended, human friends are fine too. You’re not sure the university is really an option for you, though. I mean, you’ve never really identified as a mage or scholar before; you’re pretty sure you couldn’t do anything like that.
He tells you that your problem is a lack of confidence. And if being head of the Arcane University has taught him anything, it’s that there’s only one cure for a lack of confidence:
ROBES.
Seriously, up at the university we give them out for about anything. It’s like “hey, you found a soul gem. Take this fancy new robe”. The kids love it. I love it. Everyone loves robes. 
Why, I remember when I was a young lad in High Rock I’d always wear my mother’s dresses around the house, pretending I was a wizard. Also a ballerina. My parents were so worried. It was awesome. 
In fact, you know what, we’re gonna go in back and find you a mage robe. Something that can give you confidence. Come on.

Hurray, I got in this time!
It looks… wizardly.
That still feels strange to you. You never really thought of yourself as a mage. You guess you never really thought of yourself as much of anything. Your own reflection feels foreign right now, like a stranger on the street. She looks like someone better than you. In a way, it’s like you’re meeting that mythical Katia Managan for the first time; that person you’ve been striving to become. Seeing her behind that glass is strangely inspiring and a little scary. You’re almost afraid you’ll be a disappointment to her. 
…This is silly; it’s just a fashionable new robe. 
You’ll try not to like it TOO much, since loving things tends to guarantee their destruction.  
You meet the wizard back in the lobby of the guildhall. He says the new robe looks very nice on you. The colors go well with your fur. 
You say thanks, and thank him for giving it to you. You’re just not sure what you’re going to do from here. This whole magic thing is all very sudden and a little scary. You still don’t really have any friends you can turn to if things get out of hand. 
He assures you that if Khajiit mages are anything like real ones, you’ll be able to figure things out on your own pretty well. When you have enough money to afford professional training, every city has a Mages Guild that will happily offer their services. Each one tends to specialize in a different branch of the magical arts.
For instance, down here they specialize in healing and other restorative spells, making it one of the few places that it is safe for Carahil to conduct her very important research on the effects of snorting bonemeal. Over in Skingrad they focus on Destruction magic, up in Chorrol they teach Conjuration, and that’s pretty much all the nearby guildhalls you need to know about. 
He has work to get back to, but if you have any other important questions before you leave, he’d be happy to give a quick answer.

Heh, you actually have a lot of questions, you say, but you’ll try to make them fast. 
You ask him if his friend Zahrasha lives around here. You’d love to make a new friend, but also admit that you’ve also done things you’re not proud of and wouldn’t want it to reflect poorly on any other Khajiit in town. The wizard says not to worry about that; she lives at the Arcane University far to the northeast of here, just outside the Imperial City. You’ll meet her if you ever make it into the University, though.
You also consult with him for a bit regarding how to safely practice magic. He says that safety isn’t TOO big of a concern for someone of your beginner ability. He suggests simply finding an open area where you can try to get some control over the fires. One usually has to understand the basics before they move on to more advanced spells. 
Restoring your magicka will no doubt be your greatest hurdle. Plenty of alchemists sell potions that will restore some, but that can become very expensive. Sometimes you’ll be able to absorb spells cast on you, so you may want to have a non-Atronach friend hit you with a few healing spells in the hopes you’ll take in a few of them. Ayleid wells like the one you found yesterday are your best bet for when your friends are unavailable, he explains (gracefully sidestepping “or if you have no friends”). 
Speaking of that Ayleid well, you tell him that you found it while you were on the way to Kvatch. You understand that there is a Mages Guild in every city, but when naming the nearby guildhalls he didn’t menti…
We don’t talk about the Kvatch Mages Guild.
Anyway it’s probably about time you leave, he tells you. There is plenty of work to be done around here and he’s sure you have things to get back to as well. It’s been a pleasure speaking with you and he hopes he’s had a positive impact on your life and get out.
You follow the wizard’s straightforward command.
Well.
Overall, that was…
COMPLETELY AWESOME. Wizards are about the coolest thing ever! And now you can make things happen with your mind. At least sort of. 
It will totally be super-expensive for you, though, with the whole Atronach thing. For the time being you should probably just focus on employment. But still! You’re a real wizard! This is kind of exciting! 
You’ve got about another half an hour to kill. You don’t want to rush her or anything. You understand she’s making some hard decisions about whether it’s even worth being your kind-of-friend. 
You should probably find one more place to check out before heading back.

Wow, yeah, a job opportunity where you would be in direct competition with a piece of flint. Way to find the one way to make magical fire powers seem useless.
Maybe practice our magic somewhere? I don’t know, I just don’t want Katia to be late for meeting with Quilly.
It would probably be safest to practice your magic outside of town, and you don’t want to stray too far before heading back to Quill-Weave’s. You decide to just poke around the city. Have some fun, sightsee, socialize with the locals, hopefully find a job, that kind of stuff. You haven’t actually taken much time to get acquainted with your surroundings. At least not that you remember.
Since finding the Mages Guild took you into one of the more upscale districts, you wander around there for a bit. It’s all very clean and orderly; a lot different than back home. The houses are pretty large and, with a few exceptions, well kept. You do find this stonework a bit drab, though.
While you’re not sure you’d call the robe a “cure for a lack of confidence”, you do feel less ashamed now that you have some proper clothes rather than a borrowed bedsheet. You find it a little easier to keep your chin up and smile at the people you pass. Nobody says anything to you, but a few of your friendly nods are returned, which at least makes you feel accepted. It’s a warm, cozy feeling you have little experience with.

You check inside the chapel for potential friends. 
The place isn’t very busy right now. It must not be… whatever day Cyrodiil people worship on.
You approach the priestess in front, throw a general “good afternoon” at her, and kindly ask her to behold your new robes.  They are very nice robes, she says. You picked her favorite color. Is there anything she can help you with, or are you just here to pray?

You explain that you’re mostly just exploring the city, and admit that you don’t actually know much about Cyrodiilic religion. You just immigrated here two days ago and haven’t really had time to get your bearings. 
The priestess says that’s fine. They get plenty of travelers and immigrants coming through here, and greet them with open arms. She introduces herself as Trevaia, and welcomes you to the Chapel of Dibella. Don’t let the name mislead you, people worship any of the Nine here, not just Dibella. You’re from Hammerfell, right? 
That’s spot-on, you say. 
She could tell from your accent; it’s different than most Khajiit. She’s guessing you didn’t grow up around many of your own kind. She asks if you were raised on the Yokuda  pantheon or the more expansive Khajiiti one. You tell her you were raised with the traditional Khajiiti beliefs, but you… branched out in later years. You’re pretty much unaffiliated at the moment. 
That’s fine, she says. If you’re looking for some familiarity to help you get your footing, you’ll find most of the Khajiiti pantheon is recognized here in Cyrodiil, just under different names. Alkosh, Khenarthi, Mara, and S’rendarr from Khajiiti lore are all an accepted part of the Nine Divines. Azurah, Hircine, Hermorah, Sheggorath, Sangiin, Namiira, Mafala and Merrunz all have some Cyrodiilic followers as well, if Daedra worship is your thing. You explain that you’ve had some bad experiences in the past and don’t ever plan on dealing with Daedra again, ever. You admire her extensive knowledge of Khajiit religion, though. She says thanks.
BUT DON’T FORGET QUILLY KATIA OR I WILL REACH INTO MY COMPUTER AND LOLSLAP YOU
You introduce yourself and tell Trevaia your plight; about how you’ve had nothing but a string of bad luck since you arrived in this country, and are presently unemployed, homeless, and a little hungry. You ask if there is a deity here who can help you out with this, because you could really use some help.
She suggests maybe trying to get in touch with Stendarr? Much like in the Khajiit religion, here he’s regarded as a god of mercy. If you’re willing to branch into the less-familiar maybe you could try speaking to Kynareth, who deals with matters of luck?
Both of these sound like pretty good ideas to you.
Oh, by the way, last night you might’ve had a drunken threesome with a necromancer you just met. Are these guys going to be okay with that?
Trevaia says it probably won’t help your case, but maybe they’ll overlook it. 
You kneel at the altar and reach out to Stendarr and Kynareth.
You really need things to go better for you. You want to turn your life around, to be someone new and special and better than you were before, but you don’t know if you can do it alone. All you ask is a little bit of luck on your side. Not a lot, just enough to have some things finally go your way. You don’t want to disappoint any more friends. You don’t want to disappoint yourself
And if things have to be hard for you, you at least want the strength to not give up. When you came to this country you were given a second chance to live your life right, and you need help making sure you don’t botch it up. You need guidance. 
Also you really want to know if the skeleton was involved in whatever you did last night. You’re not sure if this is in either of these gods’ spheres, but it’s driving you crazy trying to figure out how that skeleton could’ve fucked you. Oh my god what if you also had sex with that unicorn? That would be almost as weird as the time you – shit this prayer is totally going in the wrong direction.
um um um
This poison ivy is pretty bad and you want it to go away. Can you guys do that? I mean if it comes down to either getting the luck or the healing, you’d prefer the luck, but if you can get both that would be pretty nice. 
Praised be the Nine?
You say you’re done and ask Trevaia if anything is supposed to happen now. 
Yeah, she says. When they listen, there’s usually a flash of light and some divine healing. You just got cold-shouldered. 
She attempts to console you. The divines work in mysterious ways, she says. Maybe what’s happening right now is part of a bigger plan? Maybe they are making you stronger? She is sure if you keep searching, you’ll find something that works out for you.
While you’re here, you ask her if the chapel has any job openings, or needs any errands ran. You really need some money and have found almost no opportunities to get it. 
She tells you that they really have all the duties in the chapel covered. It only takes a couple people to keep this place running, so she can’t think of any reason they’d need new workers any time soon. If you can hold out through the night, though, they have a soup kitchen tomorrow afternoon. You could get a piece of bread, a bowl of soup, and a friendly smile. If that helps.
You thank her for all her help, but you have to go meet up with a friend and see if you do, in fact, still have a friend. Trevaia asks if you have any last questions before you go. She wants to help you however she can. 

You ask Trevaia about fate. If the gods have a plan, does that mean everything you will ever become is already decided? You admit there are times that it feels like the entire universe is against you, and no matter how hard you fight it you always fall back into being the same, sad person. Is that just how fate works? 
Trevaia says that is a heck of question. She’s not sure any mortal really knows the answer. Many would say our fates are written for us – even if we can’t always see it. Maybe you are destined to revert back to who you always were, or perhaps you are destined to change? These are questions only the gods can answer, and the best we can do is have faith that they know what is best for us. What is best for everyone. 
Some legends do speak of heroes whose fates were unwritten. Their destinies were said to be ambiguous even to the gods, who could only respond to the heroes’ actions – or attempt to guide them with no guarantee of success. Often, these mortals would grow unimaginably powerful, and their choices would affect the lives of millions. It was said to be a blessing and a curse: to hold your own fate, but to be the unknowable black wall that clouded the future from the divines…
…But I’m guessing you don’t have to worry about anything like that!
Anything else?
You mention your magic tribulations to Trevaia. You’ve recently uncovered some latent pyrokinetic powers and have to wear this amulet to keep them under control. Which is a good thing, since you’re pretty sure you would’ve accidentally set this place on fire at least four times by now if you had taken this off. You ask her if an Amulet of Silence could’ve kept your prayers from working, but she says no. The gods are probably just thankful you kept it on rather than burning down the chapel. Which is made of stone, by the way, so that would’ve been a feat. 
You also explain that you want to practice your magic, but the people at the Mages Guild said you could only regenerate magicka by drinking potions and having spells cast on you. You don’t have any money for potions, or any friends who know magic, so you were wondering if maybe if it wasn’t too much trouble if she could…
She is happy to oblige. 
You’re not sure if you absorbed any of that as magicka, but it did heal your cuts and poison ivy. You ask if it cured your alcoholism as well, but she tells you no, they don’t really have a thing for that yet. Regardless, you thank her profusely, both for the healing spell and everything else she’s helped you with. You have to leave now, but you hope to see her again soon. She says you’re welcome back any time, and not to forget about the kitchen tomorrow.
You remember you have one more question.
You ask Trevaia if she knows anything about the Kvatch guildhall for the Mages Guild.
There is an uncomfortable silence.
It’s been almost a year since she last visited. It was so beautiful and so sad. Every day it inspires her. She’s never seen so much heart in one place. There are no words for it.
Just… she’d rather not talk about it. You should get to your friend.
Yeah, you’ve never made someone else cry and you don’t want to hang around to see if it happens or not. You say a quick sorry and goodbye and hightail it across town back to Quill-Weave’s.
Hopefully you’ve given her enough time. And aren’t late. You’d check your wrist-based-timekeeping-device, but you healed it away.

When you see Quill Weave, the first thing you should do is return the clothing you borrowed from her and explain how you got the robe. You don’t want her to think you have the money to buy clothing and that you are taking advantage of her trust.
After all that, wait patiently for her decision.
Sounds like a plan.
You unfurl the bedsheet and fold it up nicely, then do the same to the trousers. 
You take a deep breath and approach the door. All you can do now is let whatever happens… happen.
You tell Quill-Weave you’re returning the pants and sheet you borrowed. You don’t need them anymore because it turned out you have magical powers and the people at the Mages Guild gave you a free robe. You haven’t found a job yet, but did make friends with a priestess at the chapel and she healed those cuts on your arm.
You thank Quill-Weave for all her hospitality, and say that you’re ready to hear whatever she decided. 
Quill-Weave says you’ve kind of taken her off-guard. She was wholeheartedly expecting you to show up at her doorstep drunk, naked, and doing unspeakable things to a pineapple. She thought about it hard over the last two hours and came up with a whole bunch of berating stuff she was going to say to you, and then she was going to surprise you by still offering you a second chance to deliver that letter to Kvatch. But you’ve sort of thrown a wrench in that whole plan.
So, uh.
Give her a sec, she wants to start over. 
Katia! Welcome back! Come on inside; feel free to leave those anywhere.
Quill-Weave apologizes for the mess. She honestly didn’t think she was in any danger of looking like a slob by comparison. Seriously, what the fuck happened to you? You look good.
You tell her all about how you were accidentally starting fires yesterday, so today you went to the Mages Guild and learned you had latent pyrokinetic abilities. You can’t really control it yet, but they gave you a magic amulet that helps. You have a lot of practicing to do before you can learn spells, but you’re actually looking forward to it. Quill-Weave is impressed and commends your enthusiasm. 
You admit that you feel a whole lot better knowing the two of you are still on okay terms. You’re really sorry about what happened last night and are still willing to do whatever you can to make up the damages to her house. You heard her mention the courier job was still open?
Quill-Weave says her actual plan was to offer you the job, but with the stipulation that you would be given no money for the journey. She was going to ask you to deliver the letter and get the new book if possible, but to find your own ways to fund it. 
Which doesn’t seem like much of a job, but…
Well, she was thinking it over, and maybe what you really need is simply someone to believe in you. Someone to give you a difficult task and tell you that you can probably do it yourself. 
Of course, she understands sending you off without any aid may be a little daunting. If you’re not up to the task, you could always find some other way to pay her back. She won’t take offense to it.

Yup, you’ve finally hit rock-bottom so hard that someone is proud of you for simply not screwing up.
And it actually feels pretty good. 
Riou wrote: Do it. RebeccaBlack wrote: Tell Quill-Weave to keep the stuff until tomorrow so you don’t lose it, and explain that you’re hungry and the church is giving out free food. 
You accept the job. 
You say she should probably hold onto the letter for now, though. You don’t want to leave until tomorrow so that you have time to find some food. You’ve eaten almost nothing over the past few days, and even on the ship ride over here you pretty much just lived on saltine crackers.
Quill-Weave says that she was actually planning to head up to a formal dinner at Millona’s this evening. She is sure Millona wouldn’t mind a guest, as long as you don’t do anything horribly embarassing. Maybe you could tag along? 
You promise Quill-Weave that you won’t do anything weird and you will be the bestest and most well-behaved dinner guest ever. You are a bit concerned people might remember you from that pineapple incident, but Quill-Weave says that you can just claim that was some other Khajiit, and everyone there will likely believe you. She should probably leave now, though, so she can tell them she’s bringing a friend. And that you only drink water. 
Maybe you could head up there in about an hour? Just ask for directions if you need help getting there; anyone will know where to point you. You say that you will do that, and thank her again for the invitation.
There is totally no way this is going to backfire disastrously on you!

Bropocalypse wrote: >Express concerns about various temptations you may encounter at the party. Ask if you should go to the church instead. TheFinalWraith wrote: If you take a sip from the wrong glass, or you misplace your pendant or something… Well I’ll leave it to your imagination.
On second thought, you admit that you are a little apprehensive. Even if you only ask for water, there’s probably going to be a lot of alcohol there. Picking up the wrong glass could lead to disaster, especially considering that you can start fires with your mind now. You’re thinking maybe it would just be safer if you skipped the nice dinner and instead went to the chapel’s soup kitchen tomorrow. 
Quill-Weave says there is a difference between “playing it safe” and “never trying because you’re afraid you’ll mess up”. If you really want to skip out you can, but she thinks it might be good for you to get a decent meal and maybe meet some new people. If it helps, she’ll make sure she’s the only one sitting next to you and only order water as well. That way there won’t be any unfortunate glass mix-ups, at least. 
That would actually make you feel a lot better. Assuming she’s okay with it, that is. Quill-Weave says it’s fine; no big loss on her part. She should probably lay off a bit regardless; she says you have no idea how much she drinks when you’re not here.
Anyway, she should get going; she ought to let the cooks know she’s bringing a guest. The dinner is about an hour from now; just lock the door on the way out. You thank her again for her help, and say that you’ll spend the hour preparing. Maybe you’ll brush your fur, take a bath, or go to a non-flammable place and burn away all your magicka. You both agree that, for the next hour, you should avoid doing anything that might end in terrible disaster.   
You don’t say it, but you honestly can’t think of the last time you felt this good about something.
RebeccaBlack wrote: Then give her a big hug. ViniVidiVici wrote: Oh, and remember: give Quill-Weave a big, BIG hug before leaving. ;P
In fact…
You call after Quill-Weave, and tell her to wait a sec.
This might be a kind of weird question, you say, so if it is feel free to ignore it, but you’ve been a great friend and helped me a lot and I guess I was wondering if it would be okay and not too weird if I hugged you?
Quill-Weave says that sounds really stupid and sappy but sure, what the hell.
Quill-Weave asks if you’re actually going to hug her.
You explain that you’ve never really hugged anyone before, so you’re not entirely sure the logistics of this. Like, okay, you understand the part about wrapping your arms around someone else, but for this to work out your heads are going to have to go on different sides and if you both pick the same direction then you’re going to bump noses. Is there, like, an accepted direction to lean one’s head when hugging? Or maybe a dominant hugger in this arrangement who picks the direction, and the other person observes and responds? Also there’s this whole issue of the chest area. I mean, it seems like our tits are going to be getting kind of intimate here, are we just supposed to sort of ignore that, or something?
In fact you know what this is kind of a bad idea to begin with, let’s just forget about it.  
Oh my fucking hell, Quill-Weave says, you can’t chicken out of a fucking hug. 
No.
We are doing this. We are making this happen.
It turns out hugs are the best thing ever. You cling for way too long and eventually Quill-Weave just has to awkwardly pry you off. 
She says she really has to get going now. She hopes you enjoyed your first hug, anyway. You say you really did, and thank her for the experience.
One last question: you ask Quill-Weave what her friend Millona is like. 
She replies that you’ll probably like Millona. She’s rather approachable for a countess. 
You suddenly realize there may be something you forgot to tell Quill-Weave.

Right! You rush to the door and-
Holy shit, Quill-Weave knows parkour?
By the time you finish that thought, she is far out of sight. There is pretty much no chance of catching up with her before she reaches the castle. 
You don’t know! This isn’t like the beard thing, where you just made it up to deal with some upsetting childhood event. You genuinely have no idea why you are afraid of royalty. You keep telling yourself there’s nothing to be afraid of, but that doesn’t make it any better.

Okay, you can think this through rationally. You’ve just got to remain calm.
Skipping the dinner isn’t an option. You told Quill-Weave you were coming, and she even trusted you with her home. It’ll look terrible if you don’t show up. She’ll probably think you’ve done something horrible. You know full well that you’ve got to follow through. 
Of course, you don’t want to show up only to embarrass her either. You’ve got to pass for a normal, classy person who can attend formal events and isn’t irrationally afraid of royalty. 
You tell yourself that Katia Managan could do this. Being a new person means facing old fears. It’s just a couple hours with a countess, then you’re free to leave. Piece of cake. Maybe it will help if you imagine everyone in their underwear? You’ve never tried that before but you know it’s supposed to work. Does it work on… countesses?
It should! There’s nothing special about her. She’s barely even real royalty. She’s just an everyday person like you or Quill-Weave or Trevaia, but she lives in a castle. That doesn’t mean there’s anything to be afraid of.
YOU’RE NOT HELPING.
Wait! You’ve got an idea.
Aha! A deck of playing cards.
You’ll pull the kings and queens out of this and have some little practice conversations with them, until you’re comfortable. By the time you go to dinner, dealing with royalty will be second nature to you. 
You’ve just got to flip through this deck and find all the kings and queens.
Yup, just gotta start looking through this for those harmless little pictures of royals. 
They’re in there somewhere.
Actually maybe first you’ll take a nice relaxing bath and then deal with this deck of cards. The cards aren’t going anywhere. 
Well that took a good fifteen minutes to set up. You’re pretty sure you did this right? You’re  more used to the public bathhouses they had back home, but that doesn’t seem to be a thing here in Cyrodiil. 
Maybe you can put something in the water that’ll give you a classy scent after you bathe? You think that’s a thing high-class people do?

Okay yeah, maybe you shouldn’t be aiming that high. 
If you try to do anything fancy to this bathwater, there’s pretty much a 100% chance you’re going to screw something up. Better play it safe and stick to what you know.
Hey, it’s as good as any other room! And it meant shorter trips back and forth from the well.   
You could flip the filled bathtub up on its side and roll it into the kitchen. Or…
… just lock the door.
You are pretty sure it wouldn’t have actually overflowed, but you give yourself a point for this anyway.
Doing simple tasks without screwing up sure is hard work! 
You take your long overdue bath. You try as hard as you can to get the paint off, but it’s apparently not washable. You’ll just have to wait for the fur to shed. 
You guess this bath is still kind of relaxing, though. You don’t feel as panicked as you did a few minutes ago.
In fact, might be a good time to check out these cards. 
Aww, cute! It’s a special Argonian deck. It feels like it’s waterproofed too, which makes sense for a race of amphibious lizardmen. 
What’s this guy, a Knave? Not exactly a royal, as far as you know, but he looks pretty chill. You could totally carry on a conversation with this guy. Hello, Knave. I like your tiny hat! It goes nicely with your shirt.
Yeah, there’s nothing hard about this. Time to go deeper…
That hit a little harder than you expected. You’re starting to feel like maybe this whole dinner is a terrible idea and you should just run away from this town and never come back. At least then you wouldn’t embarrass yourself or have to admit to Quill-Weave how you have this ridiculous fear. 
You hope that card didn’t land face-up. 

You try to calm down a bit and think rationally. You need to go to this dinner; you already told Quill-Weave you were coming. Not to mention you could really, really go for a good meal right about now. You bet they have dinner rolls and expensive meat and casseroles and fancy desserts and who knows what else. Quill-Weave implied it was actually made by cooks. You can’t remember the last time you had someone else make a meal for you.
Of course, it happens to also involve facing one of your greatest fears.
You’re right, this is ridiculous. You breathe deep and slow to keep yourself from hyperventilating. It’s just a card. There is nothing to be afraid of. It can’t hurt you, it can’t move, it can’t even think. You could tear it in half if you wanted to! Well, okay, maybe not since it’s laminated, but you could sure try.
What even makes it a king? A little “K” in the corner? A spiky hat? If you had covered up the “n” on the Knave card, it wouldn’t have made it any scarier. Even if you drew a little crown on that knave, it wouldn’t have made him a king. It would’ve just been a knave in a crown. Maybe that’s all royalty is: normal people with a title and some fancy clothing. Kings, Counts, Emperors – other than their job, they’re no different than the rest of us! They don’t even have special powers or anything. That would be silly. 
You are a grown woman, and a wizard. You do have special powers. You’ve fought monsters. You can’t be afraid of a little card. 
You pick up the King of Hearts. You’re gonna try this again.

H…
Hey King of Hearts.
No offense, but you look like you eat babies or something. 
I mean I guess I’m in no position to judge someone else for having gigantic pointy teeth, but I mean, at least I learned to smile with my mouth closed. You look like the kind of person who uses skulls for interior decorating. Though, um, I guess I did that earlier today too.  
I’m sorry, if you haven’t noticed here, I’m kind of terrified of royalty. It’s nothing personal. I mean maybe you’re a great guy. Or maybe you only became a king because you married a princess or something, and received a kingdom? I mean, I have to admit having a kingdom sounds pretty nice! This sounds totally childish and stupid but sometimes I wish I wasn’t afraid of royalty just so I could wish I was a princess. That’s what normal little girls are supposed to do when growing up, right? I guess I kind of missed out on all that. 
You’re probably not a bad person, King of Hearts. I bet you’re trying as hard as you can to be a good king and not scare people with your terrifying maw. I hope you… like your job? I’m sorry. 
Y… yeah.

What I’m trying to say is that it’s okay Katia.
It’s okay to be afraid.
No one’s going to hate you for being afraid.
You are completely terrified.
But you’re not going to let that stop you.
You’re Katia Fucking Managan. You came here because you wanted a better life, and you’re not going to be torn down by the same dumb phobia that ruined your last life. You will go to that dinner, eat a ridiculous amount of food, talk to a countess, and be fucking terrified the whole time. 
But it doesn’t matter. This is an opportunity, and you’re not going to let it slip past. It’s time to be more than the slutty, homeless, alcoholic Khajiit with an irrational fear of royalty. It’s time to be Katia Managan.
Well okay you’re not ready to go that far. Baby steps, here. 
You dry off, get dressed, and pocket the lockpick, King, and Knave. Maybe if you get bored at dinner you can play some two-card solitaire. You don’t actually know how to play solitaire, but you’re almost certain you can come up with a simplified version of it that can be played with two cards. 
You search around for a hairbrush or comb but obviously find nothing. Maybe slightly damp, messy fur works for you? You don’t know; you’re no stylist. You are thinking you might leave the cowl here, though, so you look a bit more formal. 
Not wanting to leave this place a complete mess, you stack up the remaining cards and use the towel to mop up some of the water you spilled. You’re thinking you’ll just leave the tub here until you get back; the only way you can think to empty it would be using the bucket, and that would eat up any time you have for visiting Trevaia before dinner. 

From a young age? That king nightmare has been with you for as long as you can remember.
 It doesn’t happen every time you sleep sober, though. It comes and goes. For instance, you didn’t have it once on the ship ride here. All you dreamed about was being devoured by wild animals.
This was possibly because the only book you could find on the ship was The Encyclopedia of Deadly Creatures. 
Thanks, you guess. 
 You’re not really brave though, you’re just sort of pretending you are. You’re a bit worried this whole facade is going to break down as soon as you reach the castle. Hopefully it won’t, and you’ll be able to pretend you’re brave all the way through dinner.
You haven’t even thought about that…
As far as you know there are no other beds in this house. She’s either been renting at an inn or… just sleeping on the floor? That thought makes you feel a little sad. She deserves better than that. You really hope you don’t hurt her even more by embarrassing her.
There! Not as good as a brush, but that tidied up your fur pretty well. 
Well, only one way to go from here. 
You really wish there was some other option. Like, something that didn’t involve a countess. You remind yourself that she’s barely even royalty; if there’s any kind of noble you can approach, it’s her. The whole notion still puts a knot in your stomach, though. It feels like you’re walking to your own doom. 
Well okay this actually makes you feel quite a bit better. Let’s roll.
You leave Quill-Weave’s house, lock the door behind you, and leg it to the chapel. You don’t want to be late to dinner, but you still plan on checking in with Trevaia before heading to the castle. Maybe she can give you some advice. 
Trevaia greets you, and remarks that she didn’t expect to see you again so soon. You return her greeting and explain that you need some quick help. She asks what you need.

You explain that about an hour ago you were invited to a dinner party and you’re supposed to be there in a few minutes but you didn’t know it was actually a dinner party with a countess and you have an irrational fear of countesses and you don’t know why and you still want to go because you promised your friend you would go but you’re worried you are going to chicken out and…
…do something embarrassing and ruin everything so you want to know if there’s anything Trevaia can do to help you treat a phobia really fast. Please.
Trevaia checks that you’re just looking for something to make you braver for a couple hours. You say yes.
She tells you to wait here a minute. She has just the thing.
This is a Potion of Bravery. It’s magic. All you have to do is drink it and you’ll have the courage to face the rest of the night. She’ll give it to you free of charge.
You thank her, but say you’re pretty sure that’s actually just a bottle of water she’s giving you so you’ll trick yourself into facing your fear, only so afterwards she can reveal that it wasn’t a magic potion and the courage was within you all along. 
Well yeah, she says, they can’t just hand out expensive potions like they are Tales and Tallows candy. 
But really, you probably don’t need magic or anything. You seem like you have no problem facing your fears once you take that initial step. Just grit your teeth and dive in. She promises you that it won’t backfire disastrously. 
You appreciate the encouragement. She’s probably right; you can do this. You admit that even beyond the phobia, though, you’re more than a little nervous about this. You’ve never been to a formal dinner – let alone one in Cyrodiil – and aren’t sure you know the proper etiquette. You ask her and the nearby town guard if they have any fast advice for what you should and shouldn’t do. 
Trevaia says she didn’t know this was your first formal dinner. It turns out she and the guard have plenty of tips.  
Keep your elbows off the table! Remember that the salad fork is the short one; Countess Umbranox hates it when people use the wrong fork. Don’t forget your thank-yous! Always compliment the chef if he enters the room. Assuming you’ve tasted the food already, that is. 
As far as taboo conversation topics, Trevaia says to never bring up the Countess’ husband. The guard adds that you shouldn’t talk about the Imperial Legion either; she’s been having trouble with one of the soldiers. They both agree that if Archmage Traven is attending the dinner, DO NOT talk about Kvatch. 
The guard says to also not bring up the pineapple thing.
Wait, pineapple thing? Trevaia says she overheard some mention of it…
The guard tells her it’s really hard to describe with words. But really impressive. But he can draw it, if she’s curious.
Oh. Oh wow, you say. Thanks for the help you two. I’ve got to get to the castle so I’ll just… leave you guys to that, then.  
You ask another guard for directions and find your way to the castle easily enough. Luckily, it’s a pretty short walk from the chapel. 
It’s been a long time since you’ve been in a castle. They are just as large and maze-like as you remember. You quickly look around the main room but don’t see Quill-Weave anywhere. 
Looks like some castle workers over here though.

Ooh, good point. You guess people at a formal dinner wouldn’t be expected to eat like they were starving. Consider it noted.
You tell the seated man hello and attempt your best curtsy. You say that you’re here for the formal dinner with the Countess, at Quill-Weave’s invitation. Would he perhaps know where the dinner room is?
He heard Quill-Weave was bringing a guest, he says. CAPITAL to meet you! The dining room is directly through the door to his left, though you’re a smidgen early. The guests typically don’t arrive for another ten minutes or so. Surely, it would be improper to show up before everyone else. There are plenty of seats out here, and you are welcome to wait. 

By the way, have we exchanged introductions? I’m Katia Managan. 
The man sighs and introduces himself as the Stranger. Spelled with a capital “s”. You say that you are tempted to ask where that name came from, but in your experience people with secrets are usually incredibly dangerous. The Stranger commends you on the capital observation. 
You gesture for the strange, dangerous man to scoot over so you can share his seat.
So, Mr. Stranger, this is a lovely castle, isn’t it? I’ve never met the countess, but I assume that she is equally lovely? 
The Stranger says yes, he sees her frequently and she is pretty much his favorite countess. 
He sounds like he spends a lot of time here. You ask the Stranger if he is here to attend the dinner or if he simply works at the castle.
Neither, he says. When he’s not on the road he just likes to hang around in the throne room. You know, sit and stare at that capital piece of countass. All day long.
Oh, you say. That’s… not weird at all. 
You decide you’ll just ignore the Strange, Dangerous Man.
Good point. You guess you could talk about yourself or your homeland, but bringing up your, er, work history would probably not be appropriate. Maybe you should come up with a cover story in case anyone asks. 
What were those unmentionable topics again? No mentioning her husband and no mentioning the Imperial Legion for some reason? Talking about Hammerfell politics might be hard if you can’t talk about the Legion.

You know what? You’re right. You don’t need a web of lies or anything like that. 
You’re an interesting person. You came here from a foreign country with only dreams, you’ve explored ancient ruins while hunting for treasure, you’ve fought dangerous monsters, and you acquired awesome magical fire powers. You have nothing to be ashamed of. If someone asks about an uncomfortable subject, like what you did for a living before you came to Cyrodiil, you’ll just be mysterious about it. It’ll make you look dangerous. 
Of course, dangerous is only cool if you are also a good conversationalist. You remark to the Stranger that he seems like someone who knows the Countess very well. I mean, at least in one way or another. You want to make a good first impression in conversation, you tell him. What sort of things does the Countess really like?  
Damned if I know, says the Stranger. He’ll tell you one thing, though: that woman hates adventurers. You want to go travel the world, explore places everyone said you couldn’t explore, or find a little excitement? Best keep it a secret from her. She’ll just tell you to stop being a murder-hobo and get a real job. 
Oh, you say. You’ll keep that in mind.
You hear Quill-Weave’s voice. Hey Katia, hey Capital S. 
Hey, you say back. Quill-Weave asks if you’re ready for dinner. You say you’re as ready as you’re going to be.
She leads you into the dining room and points you toward the seats at the edge. You should take the left one if you’re still worried about picking up the wrong drink, she says.
You admit that has recently become the least of your concerns. In fact you have something really important you have to tell her about and you really should have told her about earlier but didn’t know it would come up. She asks what it is.
You explain that you have a pathological fear of countesses.
Quill-Weave doesn’t believe you at first. Is that even a thing you can have a fear of? Yes, you say, it’s a very serious thing and it’s kind of a big deal. You’ve spent the last hour practicing and trying to get over this fear but you just want to forewarn her that there is maybe a small chance you’ll totally flip the fuck out.
Quill-Weave asks that you please not flip the fuck out. That would be kind of weird. You promise you’ll try. 

Also I kinda have nothing to talk about if anyone asks me.

Better safe than sorry. You carefully sniff the clear liquid to make sure it is, in fact, regular water.
Yup! Clear, crisp, and refreshing. Especially after running all over town.

You take note of the woman approaching. Is that the countess?
No, Quill-Weave says, this is Dairihill. She’s the Countess’ steward.
Dairihill takes her seat in front of the incredibly flammable looking curtain. You must be Quill-Weave’s guest, she says, and welcomes you to the castle. You say thanks, and introduce yourself as Katia Managan. Dairihill is sure countess Umbranox will like to meet you. Once she warms up a bit, anyway.
Quill-Weave explains that Dairihill is pretty much in charge of everything here at the castle. She keeps the servants busy, the guards happy, the accounts balanced, technical stuff like that. Quill-Weave says Dairihill is the best steward there is, and Dairihill agrees that this is a completely true assessment.
Over there is Baeralorn, the castle mage. He tortures animals or something, I don’t know. The man talking to him is Orrin, the blacksmith. They’re all pretty nice and welcoming; you shouldn’t have much trouble being sociable here, Quill-Weave tells you.
You admit you’re a lot more comfortable with this than you thought you’d be. You were pretty nervous at first – not just because of the countess but because you’ve never really been to a formal dinner before. But this seems like it’ll be a nice meal and a good way to make some new connections. Anyway, if you thought Dairihill was the countess, you’re sure you won’t find the real countess too scary or anything. Quill-Weave agrees that you should be fine, and she thinks you’ll enjoy yourself. It’s why she invited you.
You really don’t want to embarrass your friend here, you think to yourself, so if you start to panic you’ll just keep telling yourself “don’t be crazy”. You’re sure that won’t happen though. I mean it’s not like countesses are any different than normal people.
That would be silly.

You are now Quill-Weave.
Katia looks like she’s about to have a nervous breakdown. She shifts uncomfortably in her seat and tries to avoid eye contact. You aren’t sure what her problem is, but you have a feeling this is going to end disastrously. 
You suspect it’s going to be a long night. While her attention is diverted, you draw your hip flask and make your own glass of water more interesting. You are positive this action will have no negative ramifications whatsoever, and Katia will never know since clear rum is colorless.
You’re almost certain it’s colorless, anyway.  
“Hello Miss Umbranox,” Katia nervously squeaks out, “my name is Katia Managan and you are quite pretty and how are you today?”  
Millona disregards the question, addressing you instead. “This must be the friend you mentioned. Please tell me it isn’t the Khajiit from that little performance in the town square.” 
“It couldn’t have been her,” Dairihill interrupts, “Miss Managan is deathly allergic to pineapple. Quill-Weave arrived early so the cooks could adjust tonight’s meal accordingly.” (You are truly a smooth criminal.) 
“Ah, pardon my tone then, Miss Managan,” Millona apologizes nonchalantly, “the Khajiit in question must have merely been a look-alike. A very close look-alike. Where did you meet this one, Quill-Weave?”

It’s called clear rum. It stands to reason that it is clear. Unless it’s another misleading fakeout like White Zinfandel. 
Well, you are a little curious exactly how much alcohol she can take before she starts shagging the nearest solid, but it would be rather disrespectful to actually test this. You’ll just keep a careful watch to make sure she doesn’t accidentally chug your drink.
TheFinalWraith wrote: In any case, the best lie is mostly true. Crazy-8 wrote: Quill-Weave: Tell the countess that Katia is a mage in training, and needed a room to lodge, you let her stay at your home, and as rent you have her do odd jobs
“Katia just immigrated to Cyrodiil a few days ago,” you explain to Millona. “She’s planning on training as a mage as soon as she can afford it. For the time being, she runs errands for me in exchange for lodging.”
Millona nods softly, her eyes still on Katia. “Fair enough. You certainly make the most… interesting friends, Quill-Weave. I do hope you’ve found my town to be accommodating, Miss Managan.” 
“It.. it is very well-kept and I’ve already made some friends at the chapel and Mages Guild.” You can tell Katia is struggling to maintain eye contact. She seems to be coping okay though, and forcing herself to speak slower. “It’s a lot different from back home, b-but I’m adjusting okay so far I think.”
“I see. I’ve never been to Elsweyr myself, but I have heard it is much less civilized,” Millona replies.
“I’m from Hammerfell, actually.”
“Hey! Hammerfell represent! I haven’t been back there in years though. You from the coast?”
“Sort of I guess, maybe. My father was actually a steward for one of the nobles. But when I was pretty young, um…”
She hesitates, glancing around and fiddling with her silverware in an attempt to look natural. Millona is still watching her. “I guess I started having some night terrors that made it hard for me to live in the castle, I guess, so we bought a farm and moved inland.” 
Katia seems to be getting a little tense on this topic. You think you hear her humming a song to herself? That is so stupid and also sad.
You’re pretty sure she just piqued everyone’s curiosity, though, and Millona is about to push this topic further. It might be time to intervene. 

“It’s quite a fascinating life story, actually. I’m negotiating for the rights so I can work it into my next book. Hopefully you won’t mind if she keeps the more interesting parts under wraps, so I can still surprise everyone.”
You are a smooth criminal.   
“So, Baeralorn! How has your research been progressing?” Dairihill asks, moving the conversation onward. You aren’t sure what Katia was so afraid of back there, but at least she seems to have calmed down now that the pressure is off her. 
You wonder what’s going through that Khajiit’s head right now.

It always works! TheFinalWraith wrote: In fact, don’t even think of her as ‘Countess’ just to be safe. McFrugal wrote: Katia:  Take note of the salad fork. Guile wrote: Don’t be crazy.
You are now the Khajiit again.
Everyone but you has forgotten to wear clothes. 
The wizard on the other side of the table is talking about how he uses rats as test subjects for his shielding spells. It’s a rather fascinating topic; you listen intently while enjoying the salad the KNAVE’s servant brought you. 

You’ve got something that works right now, and you don’t want to mess that up.
You don’t know how many of these imaginary things are actually necessary to keep you from flipping out, so your plan is pretty much just to keep them all going. And if it looks like things are coming apart, you’ll haphazardly layer more mental defenses on top of it and see what sticks.
For instance, now you’re not even in a castle anymore. 
Okay, that one is probably a good idea.
While you’re at it you mark the GLASSES OF WATER to differentiate them from the actual glasses of water. 
Well, you know you should stay quiet, but you don’t really want to pass up this opportunity. When Baeralorn is done describing his research on magical defenses, you ask him if he has any tips for a new mage who is just starting out. 
He says that the best thing you can do is to apprentice yourself under a trained wizard. Up at the university, it’s even pretty common for apprentices to join the Archmage on his personal errands. Other than that, there are plenty of other mages who might be looking for an apprentice. Have you visited any of the nearby Mages Guild guildhalls – or are you planning to? He has connections at some of them, as well as knowing a few now-unaffiliated-mages who are frequently looking for new trainees. 

Soadreqm wrote: >Reply that you’ve only had a chance to visit the Anvil Mages Guild so far. Does Baeralorn have any recommendations on who you should talk to? You could also mention your upcoming trip to Kvatch, but I notice that there’s a plate set for someone who hasn’t arrived yet, and Trevaia hinted that Archmage Traven might be attending, and it’d be kind of awkward to have him suddenly standing behind you. Dermonster wrote: Don’t mention Kvatch. That way lies madness. ewar wrote: Mention Kvatch. That way lies interesting and insightful conversation.
You’ll let your own curiosity be the tiebreaker here.
You visited the local guildhall earlier today, you explain. They helped you figure out why you had trouble learning magic in the past and also gave you some supplies to help you practice on your own. You’ve also had the opportunity to confer with a healer from the chapel and exchanged, um,  ideas with a mage you met north of town. Tomorrow you were planning on heading up to Kvatch and seeing what they have to offer.
Quill-Weave seems to notice your newfound courage. You get the impression she approves of your conversation skills. 
Baeralorn lights up at the mention of Kvatch. He trained at their Mages Guild, he says, back before…
… theeee countess offered him a position here at the castle. He doesn’t know how the Kvatch Mages Guild is doing now, though. He hasn’t been back there in a while and nobody who has been there wants to talk about it. 
Quill-Weave says she doesn’t see the big deal about the Kvatch Mages Guild. Whenever she’s in Kvatch, it’s just closed up. It only opens later in the day, or something? None of the locals will give a straight answer about it. 
The LADY takes a sip from her GLASS OF WATER. She heard that Archmage Traven started a petition to have the Kvatch guildhall leveled. Not sure what became of that, but rumor has it that not a single person from Kvatch would sign. Even Count Goldwine spoke out against it.
Dairihill suspects that nobody was willing to argue with Count Goldwine so soon after the death of his sons. That was a dark day for everyone. At least after such tragedy, things can only get better for Kvatch.
You are actually doing pretty well! This is almost enjoyable.
I mean, sure, you’re in a terrifying situation and only making it through thanks to an elaborate web of self-inflicted delusions that could come crashing down at any moment. But as long as you can keep this up, it’s just like being at a nice picnic with great food, no booze, and a bunch of friends. At least you’re assuming this is what it’s like to have a bunch of friends. You guess in reality there’d probably be more clothing. As you understand it, friends don’t usually get naked with friends. 
Maybe you’ll imagine up some rainbows to make this outdoors scene a little prettier. 
KATIA: BE SHEOGORATH. DO IT
You can’t “be” the Daedric Prince of Madness. For one, you’re not a Daedra. For two, you’re not cra- 
Aw fuck, you’re imagining rainbows. You are crazy. 
You come to the sudden realization that you are actually in a small room with a real Countess, lots of booze, and a bunch of people who are better dressed than you.

Your looking, honestly, much, much better, and the countess has been kinda neutral, but positively neutral. You just got through a bit of small talk, and even if you were imagining her to be a card, it was still her. It’s fine. 
Okay, before you completely flip out you’re going to try to be logical about this.
You were doing alright just a moment ago, and technically nothing has changed since then. You were in a castle, eating with a countess, not panicking at all, and you were fine. You can keep doing that, and you’ll keep being fine. The Countess isn’t even that scary.
And sure, all the drinks here make you a little uneasy, but as long as you only drink from your own glass you should be fine. And if you absolutely have to grab someone else’s glass for some inconceivable reason, you’ll just grab Quill-Weave’s. You are certain that action would have no negative ramifications whatsoever, other than being a little rude. 
It’s an uncomfortable topic, but what the hell, you’ll explain.
The nightmares did come first. 
At least, that’s all you could ever figure. You don’t know why it happened; you lived in a noble’s castle, but you had never actually met a king – or even seen one! But when you were about four, the nightmares started. 
Every night it was the same thing: just you and the king. When you tried to be brave – when you could look him in the face and think it’s just a king, the dreams got scarier. He got twisted, fanged, and gnarled. Night after night, it became the same choice: be afraid of the king, or have reason to be afraid of the king. You swear you tried to be the bravest goddamn toddler there was and it only made things worse. Soon even the castle itself scared you. You couldn’t function. You couldn’t get out of bed, you couldn’t even open your eyes. Royalty and anything associated with it had become terrifying to you, and you never understood why. 
So your family moved. The transition from castle workers to farmers wasn’t easy for them, and they always let you know it was your fault. 
You wish you had some reason. As horrible as it sounds, you wish you had some teary, traumatic childhood story where you were sexually abused by a king or something. But there just wasn’t anything like that. No good reason for you to have your phobia. It just came out of nowhere and everyone else had to accommodate it. Just another instance of you ruining everything. 
Hopefully that answers the question. 
Okay, you admit you were probably a bit hasty with that “everyone is better dressed than you” remark. Thanks for the compliment, anyway. It means a lot.
And yeah, you’re pretty sure the Countess knows you were the one who did that pineapple performance. You guess it’s pretty cool that she seems to be playing along with the lies regardless.
It’s pretty good! But it looks like everyone else finished while you were spacing out.
Quill-Weave is busy saying something about how it was a one time trip to Chorrol to exchange writing tips with a colleague. 
It sounds like you just missed an amazing conversation.

Okay okay okay, consider it noted. But really, you can’t think of any reason you’d want to steal her water in the first place. You give yourself some Disaster Avoided points regardless. 
You haven’t actually been keeping track of these since you left. One hundred thirty-something seems like an alright conservative estimate.  
You go ahead and change the subject for Quill-Weave. It looks like the main course is being delivered, so you ask what it is. You don’t recognize the smell. 
The servant explains that since this is a port town, it’s easy for chefs to learn new recipes from afar. Tonight’s meal is an old favorite of the Countess: thin-cut flank steak with a paprika, red onion, and brown sugar marinade, served with blackened shrimp and a side of jalapeño rice.  
You don’t know what half those things mean, but it looks completely delicious.

Seriously. A bunch of hungry, toothy-mawed carnivores were just given slabs of meat.
There’s like two humans here; if they don’t like you ripping your food to shreds they can just deal with it for a little while. 
This tastes really good, but it is pretty hot. You ask one of the servants if maybe you could get some milk? You’re pretty sure that helps cool down spicy food.
You’ll just wait until he gets back to finish eating. You can’t imagine spicy food leading to any kind of disaster, but better safe than sorry you guess. 
You heard Quill-Weave mention Chorrol, which you recognize as one of the towns close to the Hammerfell border. You’ve never been there in person, though, so you ask what it is like. Is it worth visiting?
The Countess says it’s a fairly nice city. If you’re looking for a place of your own to settle down, she heard there were a few houses for sale. It’s pretty far from here, however. By road, you’d have to go all the way to the Imperial City and then come back west, and the roads aren’t as safe as they are down here. 
Baeralorn adds that the ‘Guild there has some good references on conjuration, if that’s your thing. You a conjurer? 
You’re more of a set-things-on-fire-er, you say. You confess you haven’t dabbled in more complicated kinds of magic, though, so you might not have even found your “thing” yet. You just got your powers recently and you’re still a little overwhelmed by it all. You’ll keep that in mind, though.
Oh, hey, here comes your-
OH.
OH.
He did NOT just bring you a dish of milk.

You are now the amulet of silence.
Or more specifically, you are the imprisoned soul of a puppy that is being used to power the amulet’s enchantment.
And don’t worry bro, you’ve got this. You’ve silenced much greater mages than this lady. You’ve had master wizards screaming “Slowfall! Slowfall!” to no avail, skilled conjurers frantically trying in vain to summon a Daedric sword, and trained healers baffled at why their Cure Poison spells did nothing. After each of these instances, you ended up with a new owner. Unfortunately, your animalistic mind is far too simple to understand the reason behind this. 
But seriously, you’re doing fine. Rock on, motherfuckers. 
You are now the Khajiit again.
The countess stifles a giggle and looks away. Oh that smug bitch. She thinks this is funny. Well, it kind of is, but it’s also hurtful! You’re not a stray cat.

There. Problem solved. 
You try to shoot an Eye of Fear at the servant, but you’re pretty sure it doesn’t work. Probably for the best; you’re just going to take this in stride and enjoy your food. This time.
Thanks! You’re a little surprised yourself how well this is going.  
You pick up your conversation with Baeralorn where you left it off, explaining that you just recently learned you could use magic. Some unlucky star alignments evidently made it so you can’t generate your own magicka, so you have to absorb it or something? You’re still learning the details, but basically it means you spent most your life without any magical energy. You still don’t really have an easy way to recharge. 
Baeralorn jokingly proposes that you could simply try to make more enemies. Anger the wrong people and you’ll have no shortage of mages casting spells on you. You thank him for the suggestion but say that you’d rather not have a cult of insane wizards or something trying to kill you. 
He asks if you’ve ever been to an Ayleid well. They are hundreds of years old but still one of the best magicka sources, he says. There’s one east of here, near Garlas Agea. It’s a long hike, but not a dangerous one. You could just make the trip every couple of days.

You totally got mugged on the way there, though. This highwayman ran up to you, pulled out this huge sword, and demanded-

This highwayman, you say he was big? Probably quite tough? Was he perchance wearing anything that looked like it could have been looted from a dead Imperial Legion Soldier? You know, dark gray cuirass, leather kilt, jagged helm, that sort of attire? Or perhaps he menacingly mentioned that he had killed a Legion soldier? Or anything to imply that just maybe he had slain a soldier who was patrolling that road?  
No, you say, you didn’t see or hear anything like tha-
GODS. DARN. IT. 
The countess seethes with rage. You get the impression you said something very wrong, even if you were just trying to tell the truth. 
Dairihill tries to change the subject. So, how about hair products? That’s a thing we use, right? We can talk about that? Baeralorn, I’ve always wondered how your hair keeps that spiky shape so well. What’s your secret?
Baeralorn says he uses this gel made from Daedra venom and crushed fennel seeds. Keeps his hair perfectly frozen in place. It’s imported.
Dairihill turns to you and Quill-Weave. I guess neither of you guys really grow hair?
You tell her that you usually have longer hair, you’re just still recovering from a razor accident a few months ago. You used to like braiding it, though! 

You’re not planning on it.
Honestly, you’re not even that scared anymore. And it feels great, like you’ve done something impossible. Like you’ve taken a step in the right direction. Like maybe, for the first time in your life, you’re finally living up to the name Katia Managan. Other than a regrettable, drunken one-night stand with a diseased necromancer, this is shaping up to be the best day of your life. You’re having dinner with a real, live Countess and enjoying it.
I mean sure, she’s completely flipping her shit over there and ruining a perfectly good knife, but something about that just makes her all the more human. It also gives you a warm reminder that if she tries to kill you, these plates will work as shields.
You are pretty curious why she got so mad, though. You swear she almost looked happy when you told her you were robbed. That was really weird and everyone just seems to be ignoring it. You better ask Quill-Weave about this before you mess up again. Of course, there’s no way you can whisper in her ear without the Countess noticing.
Luckily, you know an old trick (supposedly) created by Khajiiti slaves in Morrowind. Let’s see if Quill-Weave knows it too…
That must be the Imperial Legion soldier you were advised not to bring up. Quill-Weave lets go of your tail before you can ask why the Countess hates this guy so much.
You’re not going to talk about the razor accident.
It’s not appropriate table conversation and you don’t even remember most of it.

Quill-Weave and Baeralorn already said the Gold Road is relatively safe. And Quill-Weave wouldn’t lie to you! 
Anyway, Imperial Legion soldiers are notoriously bad at dying. Every time they conquered a place, the original rulers were like “hey, start dying!” and the Imperial Legion was like “no”. 
At least that’s how you understand history.

Yeah, it’s probably best if you just hear what other people have to say. You don’t want to risk screwing anything up.
While you finish eating, Orrin speaks at length about how the punishment for theft is far too severe in Cyrodiil. Evidently you’re expected to pay a heinously high fine even if you apologize and give the item right back? That does seem a little ridiculous to you, but you guess it keeps crime down.
Orrin says the jail sentences are even worse than the fines. Once you get thrown in the Imperial City prison, you’re never seen again. Last guy he knew who was incarcerated there apparently got sent off east somewhere and turned into an orange. At least he’s pretty sure that’s what he heard. Maybe it was a nectarine? Either way, sad fate.

You’d love an opportunity to passive-aggress at the servant who gave you that dish, but you don’t see any servants in the room right now. 
Oh well. Not like it matters. You’re pretty sure Quill-Weave wouldn’t mind you drinking from her glass. And besides, you still have plenty of milk left. 
You can’t think of anything that would make you urgently want more mi-
Oh my gods is that chocolate cake? 
You’ve never had cake in your life. There’s just been a lot of ruined birthday parties where you almost had cake.

What was that, Logical Thought? I couldn’t hear you over the taste of all this delicious cake. 
Which makes no sense but oh gods you don’t care, this is so good. It turns out cake is basically the second best thing ever. 
The countess begins telling a long and elaborate story about how this recipe was taken from an evil warlord-chef whose journey to create the best cake ultimately sent him into a diabetic coma. You suspect the story is made-up, but this cake is still pretty damn amazing.
It is very thick and rich though. You really should have asked that servant for more milk before she left. 
Yeah, you really don’t need the help. You’re capable of making basic decisions on your own.
Like right now you really want a drink to wash this cake down, and the servants are nowhere to be seen. You could wait for one to show up, but that would mean not shoving more delicious cake into your mouth. You’d ask Quill-Weave if you could have a sip of her water, but you don’t want to interrupt the Countess.
Quill-Weave’s glass is unattended, though. You are pretty sure you could sneak a gulp without her noticing, and are certain this action will have no negative ramifications whatsoever.
Sure, you remember all those reasons not to steal her drink, but let’s be honest: Quill-Weave can afford curative potions, so she wouldn’t have any communicable diseases. And it’s not like you have any diseases, since you just drank a disease-curing potion a few hours ago. And if someone sees you drinking her water, it’ll just look like you accidentally picked up the wrong glass. 
The idea of slimy lizard backwash doesn’t really bother you either. I mean, you’ve had more experience with Argonian saliva than you care to admit. 

Technically, yes, you are! But the Countess is speaking right now, and even a country bumpkin like you knows it is rude to speak out of turn.
Now she’s describing the warlord-chef’s cult of mercenary worshippers? This story sounds like it’s going to go on for a while. 
Quill-Weave is too distracted by the delicious cake! She does not respond to your prodding.  
Valid point, but you were planning to wash the water out with more cake. This seems like a sound plan to you, since it involves eating more cake.
Quill-Weave specifically said she would drink water, to keep you safe! 
She wouldn’t lie to you. If she did… it would break your little Khajiiti heart. 
You’re sure that glass just has water. Positive. 

IT’S NOT WORKING.
You… guess that’s one way to look at it?
Even then, it would still hurt you a lot if Quill-Weave lied to you. You don’t want friends who play tricks on you, or gamble with your life, or break promises “for a good cause”. You just want friends who respect you and don’t treat you like trash. Part of that, in your mind, is honesty. You even felt a little bad when Trevaia tried to trick you with the flask of water.
But then again, you are in no position to choose your friends. Maybe someone like you just has to take what she can get when it comes to friendship. Maybe they’ll be good friends, maybe they’ll be terrible friends. You like to think Quill-Weave is one of the good ones. You know she is.
This line of thought is making you sad. You need a drink. Of water. So you can eat more cake.
Seriously, that is getting pretty weird. You don’t know why you keep thinking she spiked the water. Quill-Weave specifically said she wasn’t going to drink alcohol, and you believe her. Yet this unsettling feeling of doubt continues to linger in the back of your mind.
You’re going to show yourself that there’s nothing to be afraid of and that Quill-Weave is a great friend who would never tell you a lie. You’re going to take an inconspicuous, apparently accidental gulp of this water and then continue eating this delicious cake. And you’ll be fine. You’ll see.

Yeah, it turns out most people lose their appetite after a pile of dead bodies is dumped in front of them. They gladly donate their delicious cakes to you. This is the best day. 
Dairihill apologizes for the abrupt, disastrous ending to the dinner. The soldier usually doesn’t show up until later in the evening, she says, but he apparently made better time than usual today. He does displays like this frequently, but his heart is in the right place. So very, very wrong, but in the right place.
You say it’s fine; you’re no stranger to extremely awkward disasters. So what happens to the bodies? 
Dairihill says she doesn’t know; Baeralorn generally comes in later and takes them away, probably to bury. If you’re asking about their belongings, well, I guess it just goes to whoever is willing to take it. Bandits usually don’t have much of value. 
You thank her for the help and tell her to pass your compliments along to the chef who prepared tonight’s meal. You’re gonna go loot those corpses now. 
Oh come on. He looks nothing like you. Racist.

You have no idea how to siphon magicka out of dead bodies… or if that is even a thing you can do with your weird Atronach powers.
You do take the Khajiit’s sweet machete, though! This is way better than the one you made out of a piece of glass and a broomstick. Oh, almost forgot, you’ll have to add “a new broomstick” to the list of things you owe Quill-Weave; her old one is buried under a hundred feet of rubble. 
This is kind of a brutish weapon, you guess, but it’s not like you’re actually going to use it on a regular basis. It’s for emergencies, and in a true emergency you frankly don’t care how much blood splatter there is. As long as it’s enough to make the emergency go away.  
But yeah, you and Quill should probably leg it before an enraged and violent countess storms back into this room. 
You  meet Quill-Weave back at the entrance to the dining room. She seems a bit eager to leave, possibly due to the pile of dead bodies. You point out that she has some icing on her face.
She thanks you for the heads-up and licks it off.
You sure are helpful! 

Wait… cakes are just a thing you can MAKE? Any time you want?
Your mind is overwhelmed by all the new possibilities this opens up. 
You tell Quill-Weave that you’d like to walk back home with her, but there’s a couple people you want to talk to real quick first. You’ll try to make it fast, if that’s okay.
She says that’s fine; take your time. She doesn’t want to get in the way of you making friends. She’ll wait here with Capital S until you’re ready to go. 
You thank her and offer the Strange, Dangerous Man a piece of cake. 
You don’t see Baeralorn anywhere. He must have already turned in for the night. You do spot Orrin, though.
Orrin! You know stuff about weapons, right?
Among other things, he says. What do you need?
You explain that you’re going to be traveling to Kvatch tomorrow and want to have something simple for self-defense. One of the bodies in the other room was holding this; do you think it would be okay? 
Orrin examines your machete. He wouldn’t take it into a straight up fight, he says, but if you are jumped by a wild animal or something it should be enough to make them run. You can do that scary Khajiit eye thing too, right?
Sort of, you say. You can pull it off once every day or so, but much more than that and your eye gushes blood and you can’t see out of it for a month. Which is weird, since you swear your mother could Eye of Fear all day long like it was nobody’s business. 
Well, he says, you’re just headed to Kvatch so he thinks you’ll be fine with this. If the handle breaks or something, you should be able to bind it back together pretty easily with some nails and metal. Anyway, if you’re looking to travel light, this is also a useful tool. You can use it to cut down trees, make firewood, things like that.
Huh. Thanks, you say. 
For the first time in your life, you suddenly understand where lumber comes from. 
You have one more stop to make before heading back to Quill-Weave’s. 
Dairihill said the soldier’s “heart was in the right place”, which you guess is a good thing. And he’s enthusiastic, which you guess is good too? If he’s headed toward Kvatch, this could be your chance to get some additional protection on your way there. It might even be a chance to get a friend. 
He’s on his way out, but luckily hasn’t left yet. 
Hey, you say to the soldier, I was kind of maybe meaning to ask you if y-
Do not fear, noble citizen! You are in safe hands now. How can the Imperial Legion serve you?

Hi, you say, I couldn’t help but notice your extremely interesting display at the Countess’ dinner! My name’s Katia Managan, I’m new to Cyrodiil. I’m a wizard! Or will be, once I can afford training. 
The soldier nods at your greeting. Well met, fair Khajiit maiden. I am A Soldier Of the Imperial Legion, proud and selfless Upholders of Justice and Defenders of this Great Nation and all those who live within its Glorious Borders. I trust your stay has been adequately safe, pleasant and just?

Not entirely, you say. Yesterday you were traveling to Kvatch for moderately urgent business when you were approached by a large Orcish highwayman named Gharug Gro-Upp who demanded all your belongings and threatened to kill you if you did not comply. You wanted to escape using an invisibility potion, but he had this magic detection thing packed between his angular, rock-hard abs. He said he knew the patrol schedule, and was timing his robberies so you wouldn’t see them. 
He also has a four leaf clover, so he presumably has found more four leaf clovers and is now incredibly lucky. 
The soldier says this mockery of justice fuels his heart and rends his anger. The Legion will not tolerate an individual who endangers the lives of innocents for personal gain – let alone one who uses the Legion’s very patrol schedule against them. First chance he gets, the soldier will send word to his commanding officer requesting a temporary six-hour adjustment in the patrol schedule in order to catch this vile bandit off-guard. And, if possible, additional units will be sent to patrol the road until they have apprehended this Green Scourge of the Gold Road. Which is a name he just made up now. 
Justice will be upheld. The beacon of light cannot be silenced. The soldier apologizes for his failure to protect you and says he hopes your future travels are much safer. 
You explain that you never did make it all the way to Kvatch yesterday. You came back here after you were robbed and have been a bit scared to travel again, given your bad experience last time. You were wonde…
Sorry about that, you say, you’ve eaten like three pieces of chocolate cake in the last ten minutes. There’s no law against throwing up on someone’s plants, right?
The soldier says it’s usually not appreciated, but is perfectly legal under Imperial Law and therefore fine to do. He peed in that same flowerpot on his way in.
Anyway, you were planning to head toward Kvatch again tomorrow. You’re pretty helpless and worthless, though, so you were wondering if maybe he would be willing to be an escort? I mean, not in a sexual way, you just want someone to protect you while you walk to Kvatch. If that’s a thing he is willing to do.
The soldier considers your request. While he surely wishes to defend Every Citizen as bravely and excessively as possible, he takes his job as a Patrolman very seriously and cannot deviate from his strict schedule simply to guide citizens to cities. That job is for other people, such as hired guides and bodyguards.
However, the soldier says, if you want protection on your journey you are welcome to join him on his normal route to Kvatch. The two of you would depart from the castle at 4:30 AM sharp tomorrow morning and follow the Gold Road to Kvatch at a brisk trot, stopping only to defend yourselves, defend an innocent citizen, or preemptively slaughter potentially dangerous forest animals. 
If you’re willing to keep up, he will gladly travel with you and offer the Unparalleled Protection of the Imperial Legion.

PetPeeve wrote: > Katia: Assume the ”master/blaster” position on The Guard With No Name’s shoulders during the patrol.
Just to be safe, you ask him exactly how fast a “brisk trot” is. You’re not used to traveling long distances and want to make sure you can keep up with him. 
The soldier says Imperial Legion Regulation defines a Brisk Trot as exactly three point three miles per hour. Taking into account an average amount of Justice Detours, at this speed you would arrive at Kvatch around midday.  
That sounds doable, you say. You also mention the bandit left you a receipt for the robbery, though it’s at your friend’s house right now. Would it help the justice proceedings or anything if you gave that to him tomorrow?
Evidence is always accepted, he says. For all he knows it could end up being a Vital Clue in the apprehension of this Green Scourge.
One last question, you say. Under imperial law, is there anything preventing someone from jumping up onto another person’s shoulders and just kind of riding on top of them?
The soldier tells you that it’s usually not appreciated by the person being ridden, but it is technically acceptable under Imperial Law and therefore absolutely fine to do it whenever you want. 
You tell the soldier that you’ll definitely consider joining him tomorrow. You want to check with your friend first. Last time you made simple decisions on your own without explaining every detail to her, you lost all your money, sprained your ankle, almost died in a collapsing ruin, and accidentally had drunken sex with a necromancer.
The soldier says he understands. Regardless of whether or not you join him tomorrow, he wishes you safe travels and an enjoyable citizenship in this proud nation.  
This is exciting! You are excited! Tomorrow you are totally going to go all the way to Kvatch and then get all the stuff Quill-Weave wanted and then you’ll repay her for all the damage you did and then get a job and train to be a wizard and eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. You feel like anything is possible. You feel like maybe there’s a chance you won’t fuck this up. 
I can’t help but think Gharug Gro-Upp might have been tracking Katia with that invisibility potion or something. And anyways, if anyone gives you a strange look, you can always play it off as suffering from the intense amounts of sugar you ingested.
Just to be safe you claw the air a bit to make sure there are no invisible orcs nearby. 
You hadn’t really considered the fact that Gharug could be invisibly watching you right now, and it makes you a little uneasy. You reassure yourself that he would have no reason to follow you, since he already took all your stuff. That would be a waste of time and money, something a businessman like himself wouldn’t do. You’re safe. You hope.
Maybe later you’ll ask Quill-Weave if there’s anything you can do to see invisible people.

Ration your cake, Katia!
You’re a grown woman, you can get away with skipping breakfast every once in a while. Seriously.
It probably is time to end your cake binge, though. You find one of the servants and get him to wrap the rest up for you. 
You find your way back to Quill-Weave and tell her the soldier’s offer. You’ve never traveled with a soldier before but you think it would be a lot safer than going on your own and you ask Quill-Weave if she thinks the same. 
She agrees that it is a good plan. She was hoping you’d find someone safe to travel with, and there’s few people safer than an Imperial Legionnaire. Anyway, he seems like a good guy. A little murderous, but a good guy overall. 
On the way back to her place you tell Quill-Weave all about how you were really nervous at the beginning of the dinner but then by the end you had pretty much overcome your countess-phobia. You’re proud of yourself; you never thought that was something you could accomplish. And if that’s possible, who knows what else you have in you. 
You think this might have been the best day you’ve had in… well, forever.
Quill-Weave says she’s glad you enjoyed yourself. 
You thank her again for inviting you. It meant a lot. Oh, and watch out for the bathtub that is inconveniently placed in your walkway.
She thanks you for the warning. It’s late, so she’ll just dump that in the morning. Goodnight. 
Er, about that…
Back at dinner you told the Countess that I run errands for you in exchange for a place to stay. I’m pretty sure that was just a cover story so you didn’t have to admit I was an alcoholic who repeatedly breaks into your house, buuuuut is there any chance the whole “giving me a place to stay” could be a real thing? 
Quill-Weave tells you that the idea behind cover stories is that they are not real things. Otherwise they wouldn’t be cover stories, they’d just be the truth. Aren’t you in the Mages Guild? Can’t you just stay there?
You explain that you visited the guild, but weren’t accepted in yet. Evidently to even apply you must “display proficiency” with at least two spells and be able to carry 150 pounds of books. They said the second one was very important for wizards. So yeah you kind of need a place to crash tonight. 
You’ve seen my house, Quill-Weave says. There’s just one bed and a whole lot of cold stone floors.

You understand the cat jokes, but where the hell did the bird thing come from? It’s not even offensive.  
You tell Quill-Weave that you assumed it was going to be, like, a sleepover or something. You figured you’d both just cram into one bed, or maybe you would make a pile of blankets to sleep on. But you can understand if she’s not okay with that.
She says yeah, that would probably be kind of awkward. She really doesn’t have that many blankets and is used to sleeping in her underwear like a total hermit. She’d kind of rather you just find somewhere else. It’s nothing personal. 
You tell her you are fine with underwear, but it’s okay, you understand. She’s already done a lot for you, and you don’t want to impose. You’re thankful she invited you to dinner, and you really appreciated how she agreed not to drink anything while she was there. It might not have seemed like much, but that meant a lot to you. Most people wouldn’t do something like that, you say. Thanks. 
You’ll just grab your hood and be on your way, then. It’s fine. They’ll probably let you sleep on one of the pews back at the chapel. 
InvaderGIR wrote: guilt her about the spiked water and share the bed. Onamar wrote: With her luck, there would be some sort of freak thunderstorm overnight.
It is a big enough bed, Quill-Weave says. If you seriously want to do the sleepover thing it probably wouldn’t be too weird, right?
You promise you won’t make it weird, you say! You don’t want to, like, be a burden or anything, if she’d rather you stay somewhere else though.
She says it’s alright. She thought about it and you’d just be sleeping here for like half a night before leaving. It’s no big deal. 
You thank her profusely and promise you’ll be out of her hair as soon as possible. I mean, metaphorical hair. Fins? You’ll gather up your stuff right now so you can leave right away tomorrow morning and she’ll have the place to herself again. 
You were kind of worried about staying at the chapel, you explain, since you’ve never been very good at sleeping on hard surfaces and it also would have been easy for someone to steal your amulet. If you lost that in the night, you might have accidentally burned down the chapel or something. That would be awful!
Yeah, Quill-Weave says, she knew a mage once who accidentally started a fire at a bar. Someone tried to pour a bottle of water on it, but it turned out the bottle was actually full of clear rum. Can you believe that?
They DO look about the same, you reply. You think most people can smell the difference? You don’t know; your nose is kind of bad, especially for a Khajiit. But visually you can see where someone would make the mistake. 
By the way, would it be alright if you borrowed a pencil? You’re thinking you might want to take notes tomorrow, in case you have to remember anything.
You don’t know a lot about notetaking, though. Maybe you guys could exchange writing tips before you go to sleep? You heard she had some. 

Quill-Weave says that borrowing a pencil is fine, and hands you one from her pocket. It’s late, though, so it might be better to discuss writing tips when you get back from Kvatch.
She’s probably right; you need to get to bed. You thank her for the pencil and continue gathering your supplies for tomorrow.
You are positive that you could build an elaborate alarm clock using only the supplies in this room. But that would take a while, and you’ve already borrowed enough of Quill-Weave’s stuff. 
So you’ll opt for Plan B. You call back into the other room and ask if she has any regular drinking water. She says it’s on the shelf by the door; make sure it’s the bottle that says “water”.
By the way, enchanted items have souls in them, right? Do you think it’s possible to talk to them? 
Quill-Weave says it’s definitely possible to talk to them, but it wouldn’t do much since they have no ears to hear with and no mouth to respond with. Also the soul is usually that of an animal, meaning it couldn’t carry on very good conversations even when it was alive. 
Oh, you say. Just wondering. 
>Train skeleton to be an alarm clock.
Alas, the reanimated skeleton appears to have collapsed face-first and died immediately after completing his task.
He did a pretty good job though. Looks like he changed the sheets, stacked up the skulls, bundled up those leather straps, and cleared the broken glass out of the window frame.
Re-rest in peace, skeleton butler. 
True, you’ve got to get up and travel in a couple hours. It’s time to calm down, switch off the darkvision, and actually get to sleep. 
You thank Quill-Weave again for letting you stay here. You guess it’s kind of funny, since it’s the same place you stayed the last few nights. But seriously you really appreciate it.
She says it’s fine. 
Yeah, what’s a sleepover without some gossip. At least you think that’s what people do at sleepovers. 
Oh! Back at dinner you mentioned something about a friend in Chorrol? I was listening to something else and missed that story. I am super curious though, what happened?
Quill-Weave says it was nothing. She’d rather not talk about it. 
You pester her a little more about it. Come on, you say, you know all about my sex life. 
Quill-Weave reminds you that she never asked to know about your sex life, you just kept fucking in her bed. 
You say you’re really sorry about that. It was an accident. But I really am kind of curious what other people’s sex lives are like. And it kind of sounds like you had something going on in Chorrol?
She says it was nothing. She has a writer friend in Chorrol. There was no sex involved. End of story.
It was just a kiss.
You barely contain a squeal. That’s adorable! And romantic. I never pegged you as a sappy smoochy romantic, Quill! Oh gods, did you travel all the way up there just to see him?
To see her, yeah.
Oh.
So this whole thing right now, with us bedding down together while wearing almost nothing, this is probably really awkward and uncomfortable for you? 
Yeah, she says. Kind of. 
So when you gave me that pineapple the other day, was it because you knew I was going to-
Quill-Weave interrupts you and says that absolutely any time but now would be a more comfortable time to talk about this. 
Right, sorry. Sleeping.
You may be biased on this matter, but quite frankly you’d rather not have the horrific, life-ruining nightmare wake you up in the morning. 
This is your first time sleeping sober since you arrived, and that’s scary to you. You’re pretty sure that you’ll dream about whatever you’re thinking most about when you fall asleep – that’s how you got through the ship ride, anyway. You don’t like the way your old nightmare is lingering in your head. You need to concentrate on something else.

NOT HELPING.
Seriously, your recurring nightmare isn’t something to joke about. Every night for seven years you downed copious amounts of hard liquor just to keep it away. 
The only reason you’re even in Cyrodiil right now is because you got better at controlling your dreams. You learned how to force nightmares on yourself, and as long as they weren’t that nightmare, you were okay with it. It’s what let you put the bottle away long enough to make a plan. 
You’ve never tried to make yourself have a good dream. But then again, prior to today you’ve never had much good to dream about.   
You close your eyes and try to think about nothing but cakes and fluffy clouds and rainbows and other miscellaneous, happy thoughts. You remind yourself that you are finally turning your life around. For the first time, things are looking up for you. You’re Katia Managan now. Things are going to be alright. 
You concentrate on happy, delicious thoughts. You’re going to have a happy dream about succulent cake, you tell yourself.
Zzz…

Who could be throwing you such a party? Why, your childhood friends, of course! Barry, Hannibal, Orrin, Dairihill, Matt, and the rest of the gang! you’ve known them for years. A surprise party is just the sort of trick old Lelles would pull. What a cut-up.
They’ll probably come barging in any moment. Orrin will probably be carrying a big armload of presents and dramatically throw them down in the middle of the room.
Uh-oh… what if they’re dressed better than you? It would be embarrassing if you were the only one naked. Maybe it’s an underwear party.
And you hope Gharug doesn’t show up. He got drunk and made a complete ass of himself at Quill-Weave’s wedding, and things have been really awkward with him ever since.

But you are already taking the first steps along a road towards becoming great. Who knows how far you’ll go. Who cares. You’ve accomplished quite the feat these past 24 hours, have you not?
It’s okay to be afraid of dreams. It’s alright to fear the lurking horrors of your own mind. But every weakness you find in the mists beneath your consciousness is another potential strength waiting to be refined.
Ride out the storm, Katia. You will survive this nightmare, and you will be stronger for it.

 CranialHeartache wrote: surely you can handle a little pain?  It’s only temporary until you wake up, and then everything will be okay again. 

That got a bit more violent than usual. But then again, so did you. 
But it was just a dream, you tell yourself. Everything is fine now. No royalty is looming behind you, Quill-Weave is evidently unimpaled, and your internal organs are where they belong (that is to say, in a giant pile inside your midsection). Everything is fine. 
You bawl anyway. 
You don’t even know why. Maybe you just didn’t want to watch your friend die. Maybe you wanted to believe the nightmares were just another thing you left behind in your old life. Maybe sometimes you just need to fucking cry. Sure, you knew it was a dream, but that didn’t make it feel any better. You really want a drink but at the same time you know that would just make everything worse. So you cry instead, until it feels better. 
Honestly, you’d rather not think about “what you could have been”. 
Without the nightmares, you could have had a different childhood. You could have grown up wealthy and living in a castle, had a family who loved you, and maybe even begun learning magic at an early age immediately after discovering your birthsign. You never would have become an alcoholic. You wouldn’t have to live off other peoples’ charity. You’d probably still be a virgin, too. 
But just look how you ended up. Times like this, when you think about what could have been, it really does feel like your whole life is just the epilogue to a sad story. Like you already failed, and this is just the long aftermath. Like no matter how hard you try to rise up there will always be something anchoring you to your past.
But you guess that doesn’t matter anymore. You’re Katia Managan now. Some dumb Khajiit slut has been screwing her life up beyond repair for the last nineteen years, but you’ve only been around for three days. Who knows what will happen.
Sure, you might have some problems. Among other things, you have horrifying, emotionally distressing nightmares every time you sleep sober. But you’re sure you’ll find some solution. Hell, even if you have to live with the nightmares for the rest of your life, you still have it better off than that Khajiit slut from Hammerfell. 
You’re a wizard. You have friends. You went to a formal dinner with a scary countess! And today, you are going to meet up with an Imperial Legionnaire and travel to Kvatch. Things are looking up for you. When you think about all that you accomplished yesterday alone, things start to look brighter. You start to feel like maybe this is the prequel to something great. 
Things are looking up. The nightmare woke you up a bit early, but that’s probably for the best. You have a lot of stuff to gather up before leaving. The letter, map, machete, pencil, lockpick…
In fact, now that you think about it, you need some way to mentally keep track of your supplies…

Excuse me, but you and Quill-Weave are just friends! 
Anyway, you are not bisexual. Frankly, even if you were attracted to women you would much rather have a friend than another lover. You know, have a relationship that actually means something. 
That said, you do your best to carefully slip out of bed without disturbing her too much. 
Your “best” is actually pretty clumsy and terrible.
Luckily, Quill-Weave is a sound sleeper. She stirs a little bit but doesn’t wake up.
She looks comfortable enough. You guess you’ll just leave her there. 
Because I don’t know what that was, but I know what it isn’t: A king. (Or an emperor.) Neither kings nor emperors do that. Maybe you should find somebody to help you do some research on this. Once you’ve dealt with delivering this letter to Kvatch, of course!
It’s transformed before, yeah. Sometimes worse than tonight.
This is the first time it’s ever outright attacked you, though. But like you said, this was also the first time you’ve ever attacked it. You guess you just needed a reminder that sometimes things aren’t worth fighting. 
But you’re right, nobody else has dream problems like this. This can’t be normal. When you get a chance, maybe you’ll ask around and see if anyone knows what’s wrong with you. 
Yeah, looks like you accidentally hit an unfortunate little spider hanging over Quill-Weave’s bed. It is currently flipping the fuck out, terrified of everything around it. 
But hey! At least you pulled off the scary Khajiit eye thing again. You’re getting better at that, though it can’t be good for your eyes.  
Your inventory bar? Well, it’s a horizontal list representing everything you are holding. You’re imagining it with a parchment texture, square compartments, and a little brass slidey-thing on the end. The sliding thing doesn’t serve any real purpose, but it looks cool. Also, as a kid you used to play with slide rules when you were bored; the physical resemblance to one makes the inventory bar easier to imagine. 
Oh, were you asking how it stores items? Well basically you just pick stuff up and then imagine it on the list. Your inventory bar doesn’t actually do anything beyond that. That would be silly. 
You test it out by nabbing that long leather strap. No adventurer should ever be caught without rope, and this is the closest thing you have. 
Quill-Weave shouldn’t mind you taking it. You’re pretty sure this bondage gear doesn’t even belong to her. I mean, she seems pretty reserved about her sexuality, and the only teethmarks in that ball gag were yours and… 
… the skeleton’s, apparently?
You have so many questions about that night.  
That’s a lot of crap you really don’t want to carry. Maybe if you can think of a really good reason then you’ll take it along, but you’re already going to have your hands pretty full. Not to mention you don’t have anything to carry all this stuff in.

That is an awfully thin justification, but fine, what the hell. 
You reluctantly acquire the ball gag. 
No dice. It’s stuck in there pretty good, and your flimsy noodle arms are unable to dislodge it. 
Don’t worry, she’s fine. She’s just in a deep sleep. 
And to answer your question, you’re pretty sure Argonian breathing works about like Khajiit breathing does, except with gills somewhere in there too. Quill-Weave’s chest is still rising and falling, so you assume she’s doing okay.

Okay yeah on second thought that’s a very good idea you guess. You hoist her back onto the bed and cover her up. I mean, the window is open; she might have gotten cold.
This has nothing to do with TA_’s command moments prior.  
You don’t really have any way to check the exact time. But according to your alarm clock (the ton of water you drank before going to bed), it is not yet time to RUN LIKE MAD. You have some time to kill before setting off. 
Good idea. You successfully fashion a makeshift backpack out of your hood and the leather strap. 
It took a few tries, but this is pretty much the coolest thing you’ve ever created. Ever. You even wrapped the shoulderpieces around it vertically so it has a little clasp on top. You can’t wait to fill it up with stuff.
So you don’t wait. You fill it up with stuff. 
You double- and triple-check that Quill-Weave’s letter is in there, since it would suck to leave without the letter. 
Speaking of Quill-Weave, you guess you should write her a short note before leaving.

You’re not very good at letter writing. You quickly compose a rough draft in light pencil so you can read over it and make changes. 
Thank you for letting me spend the night here. It was really kind of you and was probably much better than sleeping on a pew at the chapel. I’m sorry if I made last night awkward for you but if it makes you feel better I’m not gay so any subtext was probably unintentional. 
Also did I mention I used to have these really bad nightmares about kings? I had one again last night, but you were in it. I thought the king was going to hurt you so I tried to stop him, but then he turned into a big monster and tried to kill me. I know dreams don’t actually mean anything but I just kind of wanted to tell someone about it. I am worried there might be some reason I am having this dream so much, so while I am in Kvatch I’m going to look for someone who knows stuff about dreams. 
By the way I’m going to Kvatch in a little bit to deliver your letter, if that wasn’t implicit. I don’t know how long finding a dream expert will take so I’ll try to be back within, say, four days if that’s okay? It’ll probably be less. I just don’t want you getting worried if I don’t show up for a little while. Not that you would get worried or anything, I don’t know if our friendship has reached the point where worrying about people is a thing that happens, or if that’s just something that characterizes friendships in general. I’m not very experienced in having people care about me.
But yeah thanks again for all the help you’ve given me, I really appreciate it and wish I had some way to repay you. Oh I did notice that you wrote yourself a note to buy more clothes but everything you wear is really bland and brown, so I thought maybe you’d like some suggestions on what to wear? I mean I know gay guys are supposed to have really good fashion sense so I am assuming like the opposite applies for gay women? Sorry if that is horribly offensive, I don’t know these things. I drew a picture of an outfit I think would look really good on you, maybe you could try to find something like it? Or if you don’t want to that’s okay too, I understand, it seems really weird telling someone “hey you should go spend money on this”. Sorry if it’s weird like that. 
See you soon,
Katia Managan”

You’re not entirely sure what to draw on it. You want to come up with some classy attire suggestion that will really impress Quill-Weave. 

Oh wow, you’re right, that would make this letter so awkward. Let’s just pretend that whole last version never happened.

It doesn’t really matter anyway. I mean, it’s not like you’re going to be jumping from great heights on a regular basis or anything. That would be silly. 
Okay okay, no need to get all Khajiiti about it. You’re actually looking forward to seeing him again.
You limp over to the soldier and excitedly greet him. You hope you’re not late! You explain that you tried to get over here as quickly as possible but you hurt your leg and that slowed you down a little and also you had to make a detour by an outhouse, but you couldn’t find the outhouse so you just ended up using someone’s flower box, which you understand is technically okay and also I don’t believe I caught your name, Mr. Imperial Legionnaire?
The soldier says he is merely a soldier of the Imperial Legion – a single piece of the noble fighting force that upholds righteousness and defends the glorious Empire for the good and safety of citizens such as yourself. And don’t worry about being late, he says, you’re actually a bit early.
Oh, you say, cool. In that case: you wouldn’t happen to know where I could get a tiny healing potion or something, would you? Like, just a sip? I jumped out a window on my way here. Accidentally. 
Asotil (as you have started calling him in your head) raises an eyebrow. Potions? Surely, a novice mage such as yourself knows a healing spell for occasions such as this? 
You confess that you don’t know any actual spells yet. You apparently have some kind of aptitude for magic, but you haven’t found someone to teach you how to focus it. Until you can afford some training, you’re really a pretty crappy excuse for a wizard. 
Asotil puts a heavy, armored hand on your shoulder.
Citizen, do you know how I became strong enough to serve in the Imperial Legion, one of the most selective and skilled combat forces in all of Cyrodiil?
How?
Drugs.
But also practice. And after I joined the legion, mostly practice. I didn’t get where I was today by waiting around for some so-called expert to tell me all the secrets. No, I learned my lessons one decapitated minotaur at a time. And that’s how you will learn: by killing.
Asotil walks past you and approaches a rock. We’ve got some time, citizen. What’s your magic thing? You must be able to do something, or you wouldn’t be wearing a robe and carrying a staff.
You reply that you set stuff on fire with your mind. You’re not very good at controlling it, though…
THESE are your enemies. These fruits have wronged you, murdered your family, and committed atrocities against innocent civilians. Like all criminals, they are now target practice. 
This is a deadly poisoned apple, taken from the corpse of a Dark Brotherhood assassin himself.  
The poisoned apple is their boss! He is also target practice, but is worth more.
At least I’m preeeeetty sure that’s the poisoned one.
Yup, it must be. 
Alright wizard, let’s see you learn something. Go stand a hundred feet away and light these up. 
You’re not really sure if you can do the fire thing long-range, you say. 
He says to try anyway. The two of you have exactly sixteen minutes to kill before setting off for Kvatch, which is plenty of time for killing criminals. Even fictional criminals that are actually just apples. 
Well then.
You wanted some practice. Let’s see what you can do.

You didn’t break the chain, the necklace has a Drama Clasp! It’s a special kind of clasp that comes undone when you dramatically yank on it. 
You used to have some outfits that incorporated them. You’d rather not go into any details on that.
Right now, it’s time for magic.

If possible I want you to try and rekindle that feeling, though instead of directing it outwards towards the Aedra, direct it inwards to ignite the magic that dwells within your soul.
And if anything, the fact that you’ve never done this before is a good thing, because it means it’s something you’ve never failed at. That Khajiiti girl in Hammerfell was empty inside, but now you’re full of Magicka.
You can do something that girl never could, something you can only do as Katia Managan. 
So don’t be afraid, don’t be held back by self-doubt and self-loathing. 
Just close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

Yeah, you’re going to approach this proper, like a wizard.
You close your eyes and clear your mind, reaching deep within your soul for that spark of magic. You can’t feel it, but you know it’s there. You’ve seen it with your own eyes – or at least its effects. You have a fire in you, begging for release. For the first time in your life, something you’ve always wanted is within your grasp. Something they said you could never do. 
It’s time for you to be the mage you always knew you were.  
still your thoughts and worries
breath out
there is nothing else in the world but you and the apple, no grass, no sky, no rock, no Asotil, no Kvatch, no Khajiit slut back in Hammerfall, and no king.  Just Katia Managan and one criminal apple
breath in
feel the magicka in your blood and the fire in your heart, grip your determination to make yourself better and the knowledge that you are a mage
breath out…
Yes! You feel the magicka floating through the air around you, flowing through your veins, twisting through your fingers. It’s a part of you now. It’s what makes you more than just a trashy, homeless Khajiit. You just have to focus it…
You concentrate on the apples. They are right in front of you. You imagine the energies converging before you into a fiery inferno. Clinging to that mental image, you channel all your hope and energy into the thoughts of flame and open your eyes –
– and manage to accomplish absolutely nothing, other than look incredibly silly.
I mean, you weren’t expecting to master this on your first try, but you were hoping it’d at least do something. Especially after believing in yourself that hard. You even clicked your darkvision on and off for effect. 
Welp, looks like it’s time for plan B: think up horrific, emotionally distressing, racist cat burns and see if you can control the fires they start.
>You better hope this isn’t a catastrophe
>I hope you’re feeling feline
>Hopefully you won’t give the man a catcussion
These aren’t even burns! 
They are just horrible, horrible puns. In fact most of these just involve the word “catastrophe” with the first syllable emphasized. You hate yourself a little bit more for even coming up with them.
You rack your brain for something workable. This could take a while. 
You are now the Imperial Legion Soldier. 
You have had a very busy night. Crime never sleeps, and therefore neither can an Imperial Legion Patrolman. Instead of sleep, you simply blink more often. 
On your late-night patrol route around the city you spotted a man in full Dark Brotherhood regalia stalking around with what was no doubt Incredibly Dark Motives. As per your duty as a Soldier of the Imperial Legion, you apprehended the criminal before he could do harm to any of the Just and Noble Citizens Who Populate This Fine Country. 
Afterwards, a full report of your actions was delivered to the proper authorities.
You are now Katia Fucking Managan again.
And for the first time in your life, you’ve been actually trying to come up with hurtful cat burns. You think you’ve almost got something workable now. It’s not great, but you can kind of feel it twanging at your heartstrings. Hopefully it’ll do the trick. 
You concentrate on the apples. Apples, fire. Apples, fire. Apples… fire.
Let’s go.
Well, that half-worked. Asotil puts out your fire before it can do any horrific unintended damages. 
You apologize for the mistake, but he says not to worry, Citizen. The fire was apprehended before it could commit any Heinous Crimes. Mistakes are just a part of learning. You don’t become an Expert At Bandit Extermination without accidentally offing a few farmers, for instance. 
Oh, you say. Makes sense.
So it looks like you’ve got the basics of fire-making down. You just need to figure out some way to direct it…

You aren’t going to master this on your own; all you can hope for is to become just good enough that someone better than you decides you’re worth helping. TheFinalWraith wrote: Maybe you should ask the soldier for advice? 
You decide to ask Asotil if he has any advice. Surely, he’s known some Imperial wizards during his time in the Legion? Or has fought evil wizards while on patrol? 
You’re just feeling like this is kind of hopeless, you explain. You have no idea what you’re actually supposed to be doing to control the fire. Maybe it would be best if you waited until you found a real wizard who was willing to train you. 
Asotil encourages you to simply keep trying. You are already a real wizard, he says, and the only way you’ll get any better is by wizarding. You have nothing to lose by trying. Worst case scenario, you mis-cast a spell and die horribly in a giant ball of fire. But then, you’ll be dead, so you won’t care. It’s a win-win situation. 
That doesn’t sound like a win-win, you say, but thank Asotil for his help nonetheless. You guess you’ll just… keep trying. And hope you learn something.
Alright then. If he’s not going to let you throw in the towel, it’s time to start experimenting with this. 
Experiment one: let’s try out some apple burns, and see if that makes the apples… burn.

You concentrate on the apples and think up the best apple-insults you can muster. Or perhaps you should say “the best apple-insults you can custard“. Like… apple custard. 
Gods, you are terrible at this.
The apples apparently think so too, and impudently refuse to burst into flame. 
In fact, nothing bursts into flame. 
That narrows it down a bit. The magic seems to only happen when you get offended. You must be accessing it based on your own emotions. Of course, that still leaves you with no way to direct the magic.
It’s time for Experiment Two…

You try every idea at once. One of them HAS to work.

The apples remain unburned as always. This is starting to get a little discouraging. Maybe this really is just a huge waste of time.

Think not of the fire for a moment. Pause, reflect, consider, understand the flow of magicka that is essential to your being.

Do not believe this task to be above you. Do not believe that you cannot understand these forces. It is your magicka. It is your power. It is yours. You will find that it is more familiar to your mind than the back of your hand.
Raise one arm. Feel how this movement diverts the flow. Flex your claws. Feel how this motion inscribes a net of power. Take a moment to determine how you may direct this flow and deploy this net in a bolt of energy.
Concentrate.
To cast a spell, one must focus one’s imagination and willpower on transmuting their natural magicka into something elemental. Your imagination and willpower, they are the keys. You have demonstrated admirable quantities of both in recent times. Think of the stream of magicka you have at your command. Think of fire itself.


What? You burned your hand. Licking seems like the right thing to do.
Yeah…
You really should conserve your energy for the long trip ahead. 
Throwing that ball of magic fire was pretty neat, but it was also dangerous. You need some fireproof gloves to protect your hands, as well as some training on how to use your abilities without relying on visceral, emotional reactions. In short, you have a lot of stuff you need to get before you practice any further.
You have power now. It’s important that you learn to use it safely and responsibly. 
…pppffft ahahaha, yeah right. That fireball was completely awesome. You’re gonna do that again. 
You put your hands together and imagine up another invisible ball of magicka between them. This time you’ll try to ignite it mid-throw. You know, rather than holding the ball of fire in your hand and staring at it with a dumb look on your face. 
Let’s see if this works…
AND THROW IT AT THE APPLES.
…
Total lady boner right now.

Okay, you exaggerated a bit on that last one. The apple actually just sort of tumbled off to the side after you hit it. But it still probably looked pretty badass. 
In fact, that was all pretty badass. You suspect throwing little fireballs isn’t a big deal to real wizards, but you’re fairly proud of this accomplishment. A few months ago, you never would’ve thought you could do something like this. Heck, a few days ago you never would have thought you could do this. And it feels great. Like you’re one step closer to leaving your old life behind. 
It really does.
You head back to Asotil and thank him for the encouragement.  You really didn’t think you had that in you, and probably would’ve given up without his help. 
He says you are very welcome. The Legion is always happy to provide the Tools necessary for citizens to uphold Justice in Times of Potential Darkness.
You guess you should probably head for Kvatch now? You aren’t sure how much magicka you have, but you don’t want to use it all up.
Asotil says there is still several minutes before you must depart, and your practice is not over yet. You have shown admirable aptitude and enthusiasm in your Delivery of Justice. 
Now it is time for you to kill.
Excuse me?
Asotil leads you down to the shore. 
These are mudcrabs. They are vile creatures that accost citizens regardless of criminal status. Upon sighting an innocent civilian they will slowly meander toward their unwilling victim and, if unstopped, will pinch him or her with their claws. In addition, these beasts have committed the unforgivable crime of being mudcrabs, which is punishable by death. 
That doesn’t sound like a real crime to you, but Asotil insists it is in the legal books. The law serves the citizens, and the citizens hate mudcrabs. 
And now you must put an end to their criminal ways.
While you do that he’s going to go get his horse. It rained last night, so he suspects he will have to redraw the horse’s angry eyebrows. Try to take care of those criminals before he gets back. 

>Being a mudcrab shouldn’t be a crime.  Those mudcrabs can’t really help the fact that they’re mudcrabs.
>Try talking to them first, and ask them to join you in fighting for BURNING JUSTICE!  Maybe then you can prove to ASOTIL that they aren’t all bad, and ask him to submit a suggestion for a change in the law to the proper authorities.  (Poor Countess…)
You are pretty sure you can’t reason with the mudcrabs. For one, you suck at reasoning with people in general. For two, according to the Encyclopedia of Deadly Creatures, mudcrabs can only feel hatred.
You read that book front-to-back like a dozen times on the way to Cyrodiil. You know most of it by heart. 
See? Mudcrabs are total jerks. If you absolutely have to engage them, you’d kinda like it to be from a safe distance. And if possible, without using up any more of your limited magicka. 
Now that sounds doable. 
You lob the poisoned apple at the mudcrabs. Throwing actual objects turns out to be a lot different than throwing fire, but hopefully it got close enough for them to notice. Crabs love apples. At least you’re pretty sure that’s crabs. 
Okay, maybe that was some other animal that liked apples. 
Time for fire. It’s a weak cat burn, but you think you’re getting a bit better at working them regardless.
Oh fuck, you just made it angry. The crab slowly creeps toward you, beady eyestalks filled with rage. Why isn’t it afraid of you? You just threw fire at it. WHAT DOES IT KNOW THAT YOU DON’T?

Huh. Nothing, apparently. It was just stupid. Hopefully nobody heard you panicking like that. 
Asotil congratulates you on your Victory over the Forces of Injustice, but says that you probably shouldn’t have panicked like that. It was just a crab.
Yeah, you say, that was pretty pathetic.
He tells you it doesn’t matter anymore. Not only have you sent this ne’er-do-well back to the depths of Criminal Hell, but you have aided Your Empire and Its Citizens in the most important way imaginable: by preparing a Suitably Just breakfast for one of its Noble and Selfless Patrolmen. 
Asotil kneels down to check the dead mudcrab’s temperature and, judging it satisfactory, harvests a bushel of crab legs. He commends you on your culinary skill. You say thanks. He also suggests you cook up the other Criminal for yourself. You say you’ll get right on that. 
You know the “culinary skill” thing was probably just a joke, but it’s still the nicest compliment anyone has ever given you and it makes you a little giddy. You decide you’ll pretend it’s legit praise, and that you just cooked the best crab legs ever. 
Time to go do it again.
You prepare a sick cat burn and approach your target. You’re Katia Managan, fearless fire-wizard and skilled seafood chef. Now that you know you can succeed, there’s nothing for you to be afraid of.
On second thought one of your toasted apples is perfectly fine breakfast. 
You guess all things considered, this day’s off to a pretty good start. You’ve started to make some headway in getting your powers under control, including learning roughly how many fireballs you can conjure before running dry. You’ve got your best friend counting on you to deliver her letter, and another good friend helping to watch your back along the way. But best of all, you can finally feel that tiny spark of confidence rekindling itself. That little belief you had when you first landed in Cyrodiil, that maybe, just maybe, everything is going to turn out okay this time. Maybe everything you try won’t end in disaster after all. Truth be told, you have a really good feeling right now…
… that there’s absolutely no way this is all going to backfire disastrously! 






Miles away and deep underground, a man composes a letter. Typically his letters are signed with a single initial, “D“. This letter, however, is much different from his usual correspondence. This letter, he feels, warrants his full name. 

You are now Dmitri Argoth. You are composing a letter of heartfelt apology. 
While on lookout duty last night a young khajiit woman tackled you from out of nowhere, declaring that she was “horn and drunky” and “wouldn’t take no for an answer”. After determining she was absolutely no threat whatsoever, you did what any man in your position would. You gave her a ride home and then had a threesome with a skeleton.
Yet afterwards as you rode back to Garlas Agea, you couldn’t help but feel guilty. You had taken advantage of her. You wouldn’t have even considered it such if not for her argonian friend’s tearful insistence that Katia was “not always like this”. You may be a servant to an unholy lich seeking world domination, but you still don’t believe people should be forced into doing things against their will. At least unless you kill them first. Anything else would be morally wrong.
With this in mind, you have written a more comprehensive letter to the khajiit. You explain your mistake and offer to make it up to her however you can. Maybe you’ll send it with a pouch of gold or a couple Welkynd stones as a goodwill offering. Actually, you recall her saying that she would one day “stop being a drunking whore and become the best wizard ever”. Perhaps she’d like to become your apprentice? You’re sure the other guys would brighten up to her a bit if it means adding one more to the Worm King’s followers. 
Then again, if you took on a khajiit apprentice the other necromancers here might start thinking you have a cat thing. 

cultureulterior wrote: Dmitri> Send her a scroll of cure minor wounds, to heal her broken heart Abominor wrote: why not include a scroll of summon skeleton as well?
Ah! Both very good ideas. 
Any aspiring spellcaster can benefit from a few good scrolls. These ones were just collecting dust anyway, since you know both spells by heart. 
Still, weak scrolls are not a very substantial goodwill offering on their own. You should probably send her something else as well.
Language, sir! 
Nevertheless, you have heard that women appreciate hearts filled with chocolates…
Then again, you don’t actually have any human hearts available. Most people don’t know this, but intact human hearts are notoriously difficult to extract. It’s nothing at all like these dremora hearts, which you can just sort of pop out with a spoon.
Giving her a dremora heart might send the wrong message. You’re not entirely sure what message it would send, but it would probably be the wrong one. 
Thoughtful, but sadly not an option. 
This is the only mortar you have, and you use it on a regular basis. These days it’s not like a necromancer can just swing by the Mages Guild to get new alchemy equipment. 
What? No! You refuse!
While you don’t doubt the khajiit’s responsibility as a pet owner, you are planning to ask Baeralorn to deliver this letter for you. You’ve seen how that elf treats his pet rats, and you expect he would act no differently toward one of your kittens. He probably doesn’t even know what cats eat. 

Now that’s something you can work with. 
You already have a decent selection of potions. You think you even have a basket in the other room. You easily could put together a thoughtful assortment specifically tailored to an aspirant mage. You could even pack the empty space with spare alchemy ingredients, in case wortcraft is something she wants to look into.
Two potions of spell resistance, one potion of healing, and three potions to restore her magicka? You wish you could include one to fortify her overall magicka reserve, but you simply don’t have the stuff to make it. Your friend Landorumil prohibits certain ingredients from ever entering these ruins, among them ginseng, nightshade, hyacinth nectar, and ginkgo leaves. The exact things you need, in other words. 
Now that you think about it, you’re not sure it’s appropriate to send a bunch of bottles to someone who is possibly an alcoholic. There’s also a good chance one or two of the bottles would get damaged in transit. Still, the gift basket is definitely the best idea you’ve had so far. 
Well, this robe was the first thing she went for when you met, but she didn’t seem to care for it much…
Ah! Your treasure chest! That makes much more sense. 
You call it your “treasure chest”, anyway. It’s actually just full of old trinkets from earlier in your magical career. You really should have pawned them off by now, but they all carry a bit too much sentimental value. 
But you could see yourself parting with one here, for the sake of apology.
Let’s see what you’ve got…
Your old Ring of Firewalking. 
It’s an ordinary brass ring with a pretty basic fire resistance charm on it. Back when you were starting out with the Mages Guild, you had a bad habit of burning yourself with your own spells. This ring was probably all that kept you from just giving up. You doubt it would be much use to most other mages, though.
Your Amulet of Spell Reflection!
Not very powerful, but it was the first thing you ever had custom enchanted. When you moved to Kvatch as a teenager, you were scared to death all the other mages were going to pick on the new little necromancer. After you had this enchanted, you strode around confidently and made a big deal about it to everyone. No bullies ever did cast a spell on you, so you like to think the amulet at least worked as a deterrent. 
Your Wand of Silence.
You don’t see very many wands in Cyrodiil. Magic users here tend to favor staves. This one saved your life on multiple occasions, possibly just because bandit wizards had no idea what it was. It’s been used some, but it still has a good eight or nine charges left in it. Of course, now that you know silencing spells by heart the wand is more or less obsolete. Someone with a habit of angering the wrong people would probably find it very valuable, though.
Aaaaand Mr. Scruffles! First cat you ever owned. You just keep him in the chest because he doesn’t really get along with the younger cats.
Not a chance in hell you’re giving The Scruffmeister away to anyone, ever. Even death. 
However, one of your old magic items or a gift basket would be perfect to send with the letter. Showering her with gifts might give the wrong message, so you think you’ll just pick one of the four.

After thinking it over, you decide to send the ring. It’s small enough that it won’t get damaged during delivery, and is useful enough that she will probably appreciate it. At the very least it may protect her if she is ever accosted by a hostile mage, and it’s not like giving her a ring will cause any problems. 
You compose a brief post-script describing the ring’s powers and the impact it had on your magic career. You also explain that she can send a reply to you via Baeralorn if she wishes, and mention that you really wouldn’t mind meeting her again – as a friend, apprentice, or even something more. 
Of course, it would be awful creepy if she saw the ring and thought you were proposing to her after a one-night stand. You attach a small friendship diamond to the ring just to make sure she doesn’t get the wrong idea. That would be awkward! 
At least you’re pretty sure diamonds signify platonic friendship. You don’t have much experience when it comes to relationships or their associated symbolism. 
You really hope she replies, though. Even if she doesn’t want to become your apprentice, perhaps you can still provide tips on how to learn magic alone. 
What, at the Mages Guild?
The Mages Guild is nothing but a cesspool of closed-minded simpletons with no appreciation for the oldest and most revered magical art. And that thing they call a Kvatch guildhall? Nothing but a bunch of filthy traitors.
Well, okay, that’s a pretty blatant exaggeration. But you still don’t want to endorse the organization anymore, given its latest stance on your profession. One day, you’ll show them that necromancy isn’t “too dangerous” to support. Even if you have to show it to their magically reanimated corpses. 
But that’s just a long-term goal! Right now you have to send this letter.
You put Scruffles back in his box and seal your envelope. Baeralorn usually drops by a couple times a week. You’re not sure whether he’s here right now.

“Oh wow, I never expected to hear from this guy again – nor did I expect him to remember my interest in the magical arts! I am pleasantly surprised by this ordinary friendly gesture! Maybe he’s not such a bad person after all.”
Yes, everything seems in order here. 
You head toward the entrance to look for Baeralorn. If he’s not here, whoever’s on guard duty should at least have some idea when he’s coming.
Oh great, it’s Landorumil. 
Landorumil turns to “greet” you. 
“HEY DMITRI I have a riddle for you. What’s a necromancer, named Dmitri, and has a threesome with a skeleton rather than his best elf-friend?”
“I already explained this,” you tell Landorumil, “I just find the whole idea of sex involving more than two living people to be really weird.”
“God Dmitri, you’re such a fucking prude. If anyone else was on guard duty last night, we all would’ve been in on that. You are the worst guard.”
You ignore Landorumil’s verbal assault and change the topic. “Is Baeralorn here? I need him to run an errand for me when he heads back into town.”
“I haven’t seen him yet,” Landorumil answers. “He’ll probably be coming sometime tomor-WAIT.”
“YOU ARE HOLDING A LETTER. I can see that this is a thing you are holding, in your hand.”
“You are sending a letter to the fucking Khajiit, aren’t you? You are organizing more awesome escapades no one else is invited to, aren’t you?”
“This is a THING YOU ARE DOING, isn’t it Dmitri?”
“Dude, take a potion of chill,” you tell Landorumil. “Yes, I am sending a letter to the Khajiit from last night. No, there are no escapades involved. Among other things, she mentioned an interest in magic, so I’m offering her a position as my apprentice. Completely platonic. I’m even sending her a friendship diamond ring to signify how completely platonic this offer is.”
At least you’re pretty sure that’s what diamonds signify.

Upon hearing your intentions, Landorumil blocks the exit.
“Come on, Land. It wouldn’t be that bad having a cute little khajiiti apprentice around, right?”
“It absolutely WOULD be that bad,” he replies. “I refuse to let you go any further!”
“Maybe she’s got some friiiiennnds!”
“No no NO! This has become much more than simple jealousy, Dmitri! Think about the luck!
“When I’m on guard duty, the best thing that’s ever jumped me is a wolf. Do you know what made it the best thing, Dmitri? The fact it wasn’t a fucking bear. Then, when the drunk naked catgirl shows up, it just so happens that our current guard is a complete selfish a-hole who rides away with her into the sunset. Then you are going to take her on as an ‘apprentice’. She moves in and you constantly do apprenticing. Next thing you know, through a stroke of misfortune, she’s carrying a litter of your impossible interspecies children. Then do you know what we have, Dmitri?”
“BLACK. CATS.”
“We were already having shitty luck, Dmitri, and this is obviously the beginning of a bad luck spiral that will doom us all. Your careless actions will make our luck so bad that it will cause us to have worse luck which will make our already-bad luck even badder.”

“Look, I’ve got a copy of “Notes on Racial Phylogeny” right over here. It specifically says there’s never been a single documented case of a khajiit hybrid.

“And even if black cats did happen, luck doesn’t compound. Sometimes people have good luck and then it goes away, sometimes people have bad luck and then it goes away.

You are a necromancer, not a battlemage! Your actual combat spells are rather lacking; all you typically do is hide behind skeletons and run for help when things get too hot to handle. And while you’d love to reanimate Landorumil’s lifeless body, reanimating a corpse takes hours of rituals and preparation. 
Of course, you could just summon up a skeleton someone else made. It should at least slow the orc down while you go get help. 
“BOOM!”
“SKADOOSH!”
“Sorry about the skeleton. Feel free to ransack the place. I’m okay with this.”
“Good call, Stitches,” the orc replies. “If everyone gave up as easily as you, I’d almost never have to get my kill on. But don’t worry, I’m not here to ransack the place. I figured I’d just come in, rob the first couple people I saw, then leave. It’s lower-risk that way, and my math shows that it still gets pretty good returns.”
“Oh. I admire your forethought!”
“Thanks, I like to consider myself a professional. Anyway, hand it over.”

You present your meager belongings to the very professional orcish bandit, trying your best to keep the letter concealed. You try to remain calm and polite. “This is enough, right? If not, I can mix potions. Maybe we could work out a deal or something?”
The orc declines your offer. “I’m not really looking for a long term business arrangement here,” he explains, “I just had some time to kill while waiting for the patrol to pass by. Figured I’d make a little side-income, if you know what I’m saying. This haul looks like it’ll fetch a good 40 drakes or so.”
“Though I couldn’t help but notice that fine piece of mail you still have in your pocket.”
You reluctantly reveal the letter for Katia. “It’s… for a friend. All it contains is a ring, and that ring has more sentimental value than actual value. I know I’m in no position to negotiate, but I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t take this.”
The orc says he’ll consider it, but wants to check the value himself. “It won’t take long, I always keep a reference book on jewelry appraisal squeezed between my tight, herculean glutes. Check it:”
“Holy shit, this is a Ring of Firewalking! No, this is a Ring of Firewalking with a fucking diamond on it! It’s my lucky day! If its sentimental value is seriously higher than its actual value, this thing must be crazy sentimental. Sorry Chestnut, I can’t see myself parting with a sweet catch like this.”
“Hey, don’t feel down. You’ve provided important resources to my business, and I am thankful for that. I’m thinking I might even leave one of those scrolls here to tip for good service. Just one scroll though, since this ring’s gonna be a bitch to cash. I’ll probably have to sell it at a Mages Guild to get full price, which means hiking all the way to Anvil, Chorrol, or Skingrad.”

“I’ve got to ask, though: why even bother finding and selling loot like this? You seem like an intelligent person. Couldn’t you just as easily break into stores, take whatever you need, and cut the money out of the equation entirely?”
The orc explains that such methods are not conducive to a long-term career as a professional highwayman. “You see a lot of amateurs running around with their little axes, trying to beat the money out of things twice their size. Most these amateurs get killed their first day on the job. Being a professional highwayman is all about safe investment, if you know what I’m saying. I’m saying I pick easy targets, don’t get too greedy, and – if guards corner me – I just surrender, go to jail, and break out later. Done right it provides a safe, reliable income. If I wanted to take chances, I’d just bet my money at one of the arenas. Well, the Imperial City arena, anyway.”
“Thanks for asking though. I don’t find many clients who are willing to critically discuss my business strategies! It’s refreshing. You know what, Robey, I think you just earned yourself both scrolls.”  
Yeah, it really looks like there’s no way you can turn this around. There’s no way your bony necromancer arms could dislodge this sword, and no way your paltry spells could do anything besides make the highwayman angry. He’s right: there’s no sense in taking unnecessary chances. 
But this isn’t all bad. You haven’t lost everything, and it will be easy enough to come up with a new gift for Katia. Perhaps you could acquire some lightning scrolls to help her if she’s ever in a position like this. With Landorumil out of the picture maybe you could even mix up some Magicka potions. You may have gotten robbed, but life will go on. Things will get better, they always have. The orc has no reason to harm you now that he has your money; he seems like a reasonable enough guy. Hell, he even seemed to appreciate that you were willing to talk about his “business” with him.

Which reminds you…
“You were saying you wanted to sell that ring at a Mages Guild, right? When you were naming the nearby guildhalls, I couldn’t help but notice that you skipped over Kvatch! It still has a Guild, and it’s just a couple miles to the east. I could buy the ring back pretty easily if you went there… and…”
“We don’t talk. About the fucking. Kvatch Mages Guild.”
“Four leaf clover!”
“Looks like that sweet ring got stuck when I jammed it onto my beefy, sausage-sized finger. Figures that I’d have some bad luck today.”

–Jiub gibbed the creatures justly just because they were such dicks
For every racer seen today Saint Jiub has slain six!
The savage mer among the cliffs would hear no beating wings.
Now every man and beast and elf in celebration sings: 
He stopped the wing’ed ne’er-do-well
Threw every star in Tamriel
And made a safer Vvardenfell
For Dunmer and their kin!
When the priests said killing fliers was poor reason to anoint
Jiub jumped and punched an eagle just to prove a fucking point:
That things that flew above the land could not be left to live
That birds may flap and bees may buzz but both would fear Saint Jiiiiiub! 
Cyrodiil holidays are really weird. You thank Asotil for teaching you the song regardless.
He says it was his pleasure. Saint Jiub’s Day is his favorite holiday, since it’s one of the few that celebrates the proper use of Excessive Violence to triumph over the Forces of Injustice – in this case the Forces of Injustice being anything that violates the Levitation Act by flying higher than twenty feet. The Saint Jiub’s Day festivities aren’t bad either. Some cities spend months preparing for the celebration; hiring entertainers, building Cliff Racer kites, and stockpiling fireworks to Deliver Justice to the aforementioned kites. Truly the greatest celebration Tamriel has to offer.
You tell Asotil that your favorite holiday was always Tales and Tallows. 
I mean, I never really did the candy thing. But every year when I was younger I’d beg my parents to take me into town for Tales and Tallows. The Mages Guild did this sale where everything was half-off that day, so I’d spend a year’s worth of allowance getting the cheapest magic wand I could find. Usually a Wand of Light, and I’d usually run it empty before I even got home. My parents always thought it was a dumb thing to spend money on, since I could already see in the dark. I mean, I guess they were right, it was kind of pointless. But it was the magic of it. They never really understood. It was really special to me.
And now… well, I guess that old flame is still there. I don’t know, it’s a little funny. When I came to Cyrodiil I was sort of trying to leave everything about my old self behind, get new interests and everything. Sometimes… I guess I’m not even sure that’s what I really want. 
Sorry, I’m rambling here and not really thinking. What about you? I mean, what were things like for you before you became a soldier? If you don’t mind me asking.
Asotil says he was always a soldier at heart, even before he was given the Honor of joining the Imperial Legion. He’d roam the countryside, righting wrongs and standing up for Those Who Could Not Protect Themselves. 
Of course, he wasn’t always the Spotless Example of Impeccable Lawfulness he is today. Several times in his checkered past he even had to arrest himself. That is, he would break into prison and stay in a cell until an authority figure ordered him to leave. But he always made sure Justice was served. Indeed, even the Good are not above the Law. 
You chuckle at his dedication, but say that it does sound like a fun life. So what’s it take to become a Legion soldier, anyway? I mean, sorry about all the questions, I just really don’t know where my life’s headed right now. I guess everything’s an option.
Asotil warns you that it can take years of training, especially here in the Heart Of The Empire. More remote garrisons are generally happy to accept Prospective Legionnaires, but in Cyrodiil it remains one of the most selective forces – second only to the Emperor’s Blades themselves. But if you feel the draw of Legion service, he is sure that with dedication, exercise, and a proper diet you could make your way in. Soldiers skilled in magical combat can even be taken on as Battlemages. He encourages you to speak with one of the Legion Commanders if you’re interested in service.
I don’t have to talk to the Emperor or anything?
For Legion service? Asotil tells you it’s not required, no. 
You mark the Imperial Legion down as a serious possibility. 
What? Why would you cry? This is one of those rare instances where it feels like the whole universe isn’t trying to make you miserable. You’re finally going to make it to Kvatch and deliver Quill-Weave’s letter, and this time nothing is going to stop you! You’re perfectly safe as long as Asotil is watching your back, and if you can get a magicka charge somewhere, you’ll even be able to defend yourself! With MAGIC! 
You feel pretty good. Things are actually going your way for once, and you see no reason to believe that’s going to change. 
You aren’t quite sure what those look like, but you nabbed a couple plants while Asotil was off delivering Pre-Emptive Justice to some wolves. If Gharug took the plants you gathered last time, they must have been at least somewhat valuable. Maybe selling this stuff could help you get started off in Kvatch. 
WHAT HIP FLASK?
ALL YOU SEE DOWN THERE IS YOUR BACKPACK.
But yeah you actually are kind of thirsty. After your last trip you really should’ve remembered to bring a canteen or something this time. You’d ask Asotil to swing by a tavern, but you’re kind of worried that that might end poorly.
A while back you did pass someone selling ice cream, but it was nothing you could afford on a zero-septim budget.
You hope you have money someday. 

Though, don’t think for one minute that keeping away from booze isn’t why things are going well for you right now. 
Heh, yeah…
To be honest you’re trying not to think about it too much. Things are going pretty well right now, sure, and staying sober all through yesterday probably contributed to this. 
But when you let yourself think about it, you start to wonder if maybe today is just a good day and the soberness had nothing to do with it. Maybe a thimbleful of wine would be just enough to turn this good day even better. Hell, maybe today is such a good day that you’ll finally be able to drink responsibly and in moderation, like everyone else can. Maybe you even deserve a little drink to reward yourself for doing such a good job at staying sober. And, well fuck, this is exactly the kind of thoughts you were trying to avoid. 
Whatever. If you can keep your mind off it, it’s not so bad. You just have to keep busy, keep having something else to focus on.

You’ve heard that putting something in your mouth can alleviate thirst. You’ve also heard that chewing alchemical ingredients can cause them to release magical effects.
In a stroke of creativity, you decide to kill two birds with one stone and simply shove a big piece of mushroom in your mouth.
It tastes okay. 
In retrospect you probably could’ve picked a less phallic piece to break off, though.

Good idea. You ask Asotil all about Kvatch. What it’s like, how big it is, how cheap the shops are, that kind of thing. 
He stresses that he doesn’t know too much about the more laid-back aspects of city-life (such as shopping, sleeping, and basic social interaction), but does his best to answer your questions anyway. He explains that Kvatch is a mountaintop city with a strong military history – though there’s not much demand for fighters there these days. It’s about same size as the city of Anvil, and the crime rate is far lower. Its heavily defensible location means it’s also one of the safest places to live during Times of Trouble. Well, one time in the past it did get utterly destroyed in an invasion, but things like that typically don’t happen twice. 
You write down as much of this as you can. Kvatch is a whole new opportunity for you, and you want to make sure you’re starting on the right foot. You want to make sure you know exactly what awaits you. You also ask Asotil how safe the areas around the city are. Like, would it be safe to leave Kvatch on your own if you need something outside?
He says that it’s generally quite safe, as long as you stay out of old ruins. Though, there seems to be an unusually high amount of Criminal Scum out this morning. Usually at this time of day you’d see one, two outlaws tops. Might be an upward trend, so stay vigilant. 
You have one more question pressing on your mind…
I’m not sure if this is a taboo topic, you begin, but what exactly is the deal with the Kvatch Mages guild? I mean, half the people I’ve met refuse to talk about it, the other half seem to know nothing at all about it.
Asotil tells you that it’s a complicated situation. The Kvatch Mages Guild used to have a lot of enemies. Its practices were legal (and therefore perfectly fine), but many citizens still disapproved. After the necromancy ban cleared the place out, everyone was planning to simply destroy the building. 
That is, until she arrived.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Truly, words cannot do her justice, friend Khajiit! Bold and outgoing, strong and alluring. Skin as fair as snow, hair as gold as… gold. Her smile alone could light the darkest nights, her tears could shatter the stoniest heart. Yet below the surface, there was something dark and manipulative, sad yet hopeful. Lawless yet noble. Oh how scandalously she could skirt the edges of every law, every regulation – following all the rules but playing her own, mysterious game. She was something different. Something unusual. Something amazing. Her very name was like divine song:
Most of Kvatch had come to hate mages, but it didn’t matter. Within a single day, she had won the support of every citizen. She made them realize they needed a Kvatch Mages Guild. She made us all see that it was the Most Important Thing.
Of course, the Kvatch guildhall still has a few enemies. But she’ll show them they were wrong. 
Sigrid will show them all.

You remark that Sigrid certainly sounds like a very… interesting lady. How long have you had feelings for her?
Feelings? Asotil says he didn’t mean he was in love with her. That stuff about her being the most amazing woman in the world was a statement of fact, not endearment. He’s only ever met her once, when he was filing his Justice Report with the Count.
Oh, you reply.
Maaaaybe it’s better if you don’t push this line of inquiry any further.

You don’t need to take inventory, because you can just:
Fwooosh!
Oh, whoops, forgot to list your clothes and stuff. You decide to mark the robe and amulet a slightly darker color to signify that you’re actually wearing them.
Anyway, you’ve got all the stuff from Quill-Weave’s place, a bunch of plants you picked up, and the remaining half of your wizard’s staff. Your plan to carve decorations into the staff didn’t turn out so well, but maybe you can burn its remains into a piece of charcoal for doing art. You’ve never used charcoal before, but Quill-Weave said you were okay at drawing. Maybe it’ll work out, and you will have finally found your “thing”. 
You’re… not really sure how to judge your magicka levels. Bear in mind that your magicka-tank or whatever has been pretty much empty for the last nineteen years. You haven’t had much time to feel the difference between “full” and “depleted”. You’re not even entirely sure what you’re supposed to be feeling for. It’s probably something that just comes intuitively to most people who grew up with it.
As for your health, you guess your health is pretty good. I mean, you don’t smoke, you get a decent amount of cardio exercise, and whenever possible you are careful to augment your voracious carnivore appetite with a Khajiit-appropriate amount of fruits and vegetables. Your alcohol intake has probably left you at serious risk for liver failure, but you haven’t noticed any symptoms yet so you guess you’re lucky there. And other than an allergy or two, you aren’t aware of any chronic medical conditions. 
So yeah, your health is fine. 
It looks like it’s just a reference text on cross-cultural grammar differences. You guess that’s something a professional writer would care about? You flip through the first few pages but it’s pretty dry and, due to your drunken scrawlings, mostly illegible. 
This edit makes you giggle though. 
You tell Asotil that when you finally make it to Kvatch you were hoping to sell some goods to make a little money, to help get started. Would it be okay for you to, like, take any valuables off those corpses? Or would that be tampering with evidence?
He says to help yourself. Criminal Scum has no rights, including property rights, so it’s always acceptable to take their belongings whenever you want. Just make sure you leave enough of the body there for him to report how many Criminals were Apprehended In The Name Of Justice today. 
You thank him for the permission, slip out of his arms, and climb onto the moving corpse raft. 
Hm…. you don’t see anything easily lootable on these guys, like weapons or shields. You’re not entirely sure where to begin on a more thorough search. The whole concept is a little morbid.

If done correctly, you should have a tally of their current inventory and should be able to abstractly pick them from their bodies with little muss or fuss.

Look, you seriously don’t want to think about booze, drinking habits, or anything like that right now. That’s always when things start going downhill for you. Quill-Weave is counting on you to stay sober and finish this job, and you have no intentions of even tempting fate this time.
But if it answers your questions: yes, you realize your low tolerance is unusual. It’s been that way since you first started drinking and – for whatever reason – hasn’t changed much since. And no, you don’t black out every time you’re drunk. Sometimes in the morning you can remember every one of the dumb things you said or did, and it usually makes you feel a thousand times worse about yourself. 
But whatever, it doesn’t matter anymore. You’ve drank for the last time ever and you’re leaving those days behind you. You’re well on your way to becoming a constructive, respectable member of Imperial society. You’re going to forget all these old problems, get a job, make some friends, join a guild, buy a house… normal people things. You’re Katia Managan now. People are going to look at you and see more than a worthless Khajiit slut who screwed up every opportunity she was ever given and ruined every friendship she ever had. 
You’ve hit some bumps, yeah, and you’ve started to accept that this isn’t going to be easy. But you can do it. Katia Managan can do it. She’s brave, and doesn’t have to hide her face in a tankard every time something goes wrong. She’s strong, and when things get tough she can just shrug it off and keep moving forward. Failures happen, you guess, but hey…
Maybe things are starting to look up.
Maybe even merge the gray haired goblin’s piece of clothing with the fur to create some kind of ultra stilish outfit that every traveler would like to wear. That would be a hit!
Well, okay, your badass wolf-skin armor doesn’t turn out so great. But other things are still looking up!
Across the road you spy the vague form of a mountaintop city. Kvatch! You’re almost there! And it’s about time, too. For this entire trip you’ve been kind of worried that something horrible would happen when you least expected it, completely negating any progress you made. But no, you’re totally going to make it to Kvatch and deliver Quill-Weave’s letter and earn some money and find some friends and eeeeeee oh my gods you can do anything. 
You excitedly catch up with Asotil and make sure that this is indeed Kvatch, and not some kind of horrible, hope-dashing mirage. He confirms that it is Kvatch, and says you’ll arrive within the hour. Hopefully you’ve found your journey along this Fine Imperial Road to be adequately Safe, Just, and Lawful?
You tell him that the trip was nice, but you’re glad it’s almost over. Your inventory bar is getting really full by now. Asotil declines to comment on this.

Right! You will be the very paragon of presentability! 
You rub the blood out of your fur and clothes as best you can, move your inventory into its new carrying case, and throw your now-empty hood back over your shoulders. You make sure your alchemy ingredients are safely stored for later sale and wrap the wolf pelts up so they don’t get blood on anything else. And also, just to be safe, you double- and triple- and quadruple-check that you still have Quill-Weave’s letter.
Knowing that you might actually have a chance to do something right is a little nervewracking. You’re not taking any chances here.

Hey, even if a magical light ring would be useless to you, it would probably fetch a good price among humans, elves, or anyone else who can’t see in the dark.
But no, this looks like it’s just a fairly ordinary copper ring. You know, the kind of thing people who have money wear to look prettier. You shove the ring onto one of your hideous, catlike fingers and confirm that it has no apparent magical properties. 
You guess it does make you feel a little prettier, though. 
Katia: Ask Asotil what is in his hands. If it is booze, ask for a sip. Just a sip.
W.. what booze? That’s just his GLASS OF WATER. 
A glass of… special poisoned water that only Legion Patrolmen can safely drink. Yeah. No reason to pay any attention to it, or to believe that maybe he’d offer you a swig of it. 
You decide to hang back a bit and pretend you’re picking more plants while Asotil finishes drinking his WATER. 
Your leg is feeling much better by now, so walking without the staff isn’t much trouble. Anyway, You’re almost to Kvatch so it’s probably good to stretch your legs a little. An inviting column of smoke rises from the front of the city; someone must have made a campfire nearby, perhaps to cook some delicious food. You think you can make out the scent of bacon, but that might be from one of the taverns you passed. 
Just ahead, the road forks into two paths. At Asotil’s command, the horse stops.
Alas Fair Khajiit Maiden, Asotil begins, I am afraid this is where we must part ways. While I wish I could individually protect every single Citizen of Cyrodiil at all hours, I have Duties to which I must attend. The path to your left will lead you up to Kvatch, and I hope the remainder of your trip goes smoothly even without the Unparalleled Protection of the Imperial Legion.
You tell him it’s fine, you understand. The city’s only like a quarter of a mile away and you can probably just yell for the Kvatch guards if anything comes up. I thought you had to drop the dead bodies off with the Count, though?
Asotil explains that Count Goldwine has apparently been very busy lately, as he has requested that all his justice Reports be forwarded to Countess Umbranox until further notice. Anyway, there is a more Pressing Matter that the Legion must attend to as soon as possible. You mentioned you had evidence of a robbery? 
Oh, right, Gharug’s receipt! You forgot to even list it in your inventory. You hand Asotil the small slip of paper and thank him for taking the crime so seriously. 
He says that it’s the Legion’s job to take every single crime incredibly seriously no matter what. And a highwayman using the Legion’s very own patrol schedule to endanger the lives of Innocent Civilians? A travesty like that must be reported to his commanding officer in the Imperial City at once. Hopefully this single receipt will be enough to get the patrol schedule shifted and additional reinforcements deployed. Whatever his superiors decide, he promises that this Green Scourge will be apprehended as swiftly as possible. The song of Justice cannot be extinguished and the glorious light of the Empire will never silence.
If you have any further questions before he sets off, he says, he’ll be happy to answer them.
You tell Asotil that you are a bit concerned about the return trip when it comes time for you to leave Kvatch. You told your best friend you’d be back within four days, and if you stay any longer she might get worried and send out a search party or something. At least you’re pretty sure that’s something she would do for you. Anyway, will there be a patrol or something in the next couple days you could travel back with?
Asotil says not to worry about it. If his trip to the Imperial City goes swiftly, the Kvatch Guard will receive a copy of his new schedule and can tell you when to meet him. If he’s not back by the time you leave… well, this road is usually quite safe, and after an especially busy Justice Day like today it can take a while for new Criminal Scum to move in. The road should be safe enough to travel on your own as long as you leave sometime within the next three days. 
That shouldn’t be a problem, you say. You can’t think of anything that would hold you in Kvatch for more than three days. 
He adds that his patrol schedule currently has him leaving Kvatch at 5 PM. You may want to do so as well, in case the Green Scourge has not been Apprehended by the time you leave. You agree that this is probably a good idea; better safe than sorry. 

Also, is that a fire?
Asotil squints at the distant flames and says it’s probably nothing to worry about. That citizen in a red robe looks to have the fire properly controlled.
Oh, whew, you say. For a minute you were getting this feeling that something really bad was going to happen.
Professorzobot wrote: Guys guys guys… we ought to keep it short for right now.
Katia: Give Asotil a hug. ViniVidiVici wrote: OH, also thank Asotil for being such a good company. And most of all: FOR BELIEVING IN YOU. ;D
Well then. You guess this is it…
You thank Asotil for all his help. You probably couldn’t have made it here without him, you explain, and it really means a lot to you. 
And, well, it probably sounds sappy and stupid, but most of all you kind of want to thank him for believing in you. For taking you seriously, and not just treating you like some loser Khajiit with a magic fantasy. For making it seem like you could do anything (legal) if you put your mind to it. Most people don’t treat you like that. 
He tells you he was merely doing his Just and Honorable Duty by helping an Innocent Citizen in need. With any luck, his actions have made your life – and all of Cyrodiil – a Safer Place. He wishes you safe travels on the short remainder of your trip and hopes your business in Kvatch goes well. 
Asotil notes that you still have some Criminal blood on the back of your belt. 
Oh, thanks, you say. It’s probably soaked in by now, but you can just turn it inside out.
Without further delay, Asotil mounts his steed and sets off for the Imperial City. You call after him, thanking him once again for everything he’s done and wishing him good luck on his own journey. He throws you a quick nod in response. Stay safe, Citizen. Stay alert.
Wow that is a super depressing way to look at everything that just happened. Ugh.
Yes, you recognize you’ve had this kind of pattern where, just as things are looking up, everything tends to come crashing down. 
But back home in Hammerfell, you had a pattern as well. Every day, you disappointed yourself. Every night, you drank the disappointment away. There was no silver lining, no hope that maybe tomorrow would be better. You lived your life knowing you were worth nothing and that that would never change. It was the same, inescapable pattern every day.
But you escaped anyway. Or maybe Katia Managan did. 
And sure, things haven’t been going completely perfect for her. Yeah, there’s that troubling pattern you described where things that are going well end up backfiring horrifically. But you just have to keep reminding yourself: it’s still better. Even if you can only be happy for a fleeting moment before it’s taken away from you, that’s more than you had before. At least you finally have hopes to dash.
And hey, if you were able to break a pattern once, maybe it’ll happen again. Everything bad that’s happened since you arrived, maybe that’s all in the past now. Maybe it was all just the short, painful prequel to something really great. Something that, over these last two days, has been just beginning.
So yeah, who gives a flying fuck about patterns? From here on out, things are gonna work. You’re gonna deliver Quill-Weave’s letter, get her a new book, find a job, make all the friends, and become the Katia Managan you believed in when you first stepped off that ship. Things are gonna be different this time, and you don’t care what luck, destiny, pattern recognition, narrative foreshadowing or whatever else has to say about it.

Perhaps use your excellent Kajiit climbing skills to hide in a tree and spy for a while? 
You promptly disregard all this perfectly reasonable advice and excitedly scramble up the winding mountain path as quickly as you can.
This is going to be so great!

Of course before doing that, you should try to recover more mana, and also decide on a price that Tavia would be willing to pay you for dealing with the Imps.

You remind Hirtel that even though you are a professional courier, accidents can still happen. His letter would probably be much safer in a nice, sturdy envelope. 
He strokes his chin thoughtfully, pondering your request. An envelope would be functional, sure… but he doesn’t know if it would be insulting enough.
Unless…
… I make the entire letter ironically uninsulting! Brilliant! 
Hirtel quickly begins scribbling out a new letter on a fresh sheet of paper. He tells you to check the ground and see if you can find a leather-bound book on restoration magic; he has an idea how to make this ironically uninsulting letter even more ironically uninsulting. 
You hand him the requested book, which he quickly wraps up and attaches to the letter. He presents you with the completed, gift-wrapped package. Hopefully you don’t mind carrying a slightly heavier reply back to Quill-Weave?
You tell him it’s fine, you don’t mind. Though you are, ah, a little curious why he’s trying to write an insulting letter? 
Hirtel says it’s just an inside joke between him and Q.W., don’t worry about it. You’re the courier, all you have to do is… courry. Just make sure you don’t open this or anything; he wants it to still look kind of nice when it reaches her. Ironically nice. 
You say that shouldn’t be a problem. You’re turning out to be surprisingly good at following simple, straightforward directions without messing up. 
Anyway, that book I was looking to purchase…
Hirtel sets the package aside. Oh, right. Throw it on the counter, let’s figure out a price.
Eh, sure, why not. You puff out your chest and straighten up your back a little, trying to strike a confident, businesswomanly posture. You can’t tell if it’s working or not. 
Hirtel stares intently at the grammar book and eventually confesses he doesn’t actually know the first thing about how much books are worth. He used to have a book on book pricing, but then someone bought it. So now he just kind of tries to puzzle this stuff out on his own, see what people are willing to pay. 
This book has a lot of pages and words in it. How’s, like… forty drakes sound?

Especially once he’s ADMITTED he doesn’t know what a fair price would be! Haggle with him! See if you can drive the price down. 
You quickly learn that haggling is much more complicated than you thought.
After about ten minutes of your best bargain-making, you only manage to talk the price down to thirty five septims. You play every card in your deck – explaining that the book isn’t worth much, trying to organize a trade, even insisting you deserve a lower price as part of a courier fee – but none of it works out all that well. Hirtel claims the book’s possible rarity makes it worth more. He refuses to accept any payment other than gold. He even says your courier services are worth five septims at most – after all, you’re just delivering the letter one town away. That’s not even dangerous.
Running out of good alternatives, you decide to try a personal appeal. If he replaced the book for free, maybe that would be even more ironically uninsulting to Quill-Weave? She’d probably be… offended by how courteous it was! Eh? Right?
Hirtel turns down your offer. Books are expensive, he says, and he can’t just hand them out for free. He only did that with the restoration book because books on magic are only worth one septim. At least that’s what the lady from the Mages Guild told him.
Anyway, as a shopkeeper he likes to keep business courteous and fair. You ruined Quill-Weave’s book, therefore he thinks that you should be the one to replace it. Free-riding on his charity to cover up your mistake would just be… unironically rude.
His remark about free-riding on charity hits a nerve. You uncomfortably explain that you didn’t mean it like that. You just thought maybe… nevermind. Sorry.
Hirtel suggests that you just buckle down and pay the thirty five septims. Some shopkeepers are into this whole haggling thing, but he really just wants to get this over with so he can get back to building book pyramids. So are you going to buy the book or not? 
You reluctantly confess that you don’t actually have that much money to your name right now. That’s part of the reason you wanted to drive the price down: you’re going through a kind of hard time money-wise. 
But you really need that book. Quill-Weave is counting on you to get her a new copy, and you can’t let her down. You’ll totally be back in a day or two with the money, and you’ll buy the book then. That’s okay, right?
Hirtel sighs and tells you to stop looking all mopey. It’s fine. You’re not the first penniless courier Q.W. has sent here on some sort of pity mission. He’ll even put the book in reserve to make sure nobody buys it before you. Just try to hurry up about it.
You thank him, and promise you’ll be back as soon as you can with some actual money. Thanks.
In fact, maybe the two of you could even strike up a deal or something, if he needs some work done? You suggest that maybe you could tidy his shop up a bit, earn a little extra-
Woah woah woah, Hirtel interrupts.
First you come in here with no money, then you waste half an hour trying to pay me with artwork and grass clippings, and now you’re insinuating something’s wrong with my store?
He kindly informs you that he is the bookstore guy, not you. Do you own a bookstore? No? Then apparently you don’t know the first thing about bookstoring. 
Now go on, shoo, run off now. We’ve said everything that’s to be said; come back when you have some actual coin. 
Well.
That didn’t go so bad, you guess.
You delivered Quill-Weave’s letter, met her friend, and now you’ve just got to scrounge up thirty five septims to buy her a new book. Well, thirty five septims plus however much it’ll cost for you to eat and sleep while you’re in Kvatch. 
But you can… probably do that? Yeah. That works out to more than you expected, but you’ve still got plenty of loot to sell and a couple work opportunities scoped out. Before you know it, your empty pocket will have twenty septims in it. Then fifty. Then a hundred. Piece of cake. 
Oh gods, that would be the coolest thing ever! And for all you know you actually could have some hidden magical talent just waiting to be discovered and honed. Something about that potentially untapped potential makes you giddy. It’d certainly solve some problems, too: with two spells you’d actually be able to join the Mages Guild proper, meaning a free place to stay whenever you need it.
Of course, the Kvatch Mages Guild probably isn’t open yet, so you can’t confer with the wizards there. But tonight… tonight is going to be great. 
In the meantime, you better get started on earning some money.
Ooh, right! You grabbed it on your way out, almost forgot about it. Let’s see what kind of strange and exciting correspondence Quill-Weave and Hirtel have been exchanging.
Gods blood your such a dumb lizard. Maybe if you could tell the difference between your esophogas (Sp??) and your windpipe then you would know which one food goes down. Next time you choke I hope you die because I hate you. I don’t even need you, I could probably write better than you if I tried (I’m not trying right now). Also your fat.
Your best elf-friend,
HURTel
P.S. sure I’ll preorder the usual 20 copies. Pay me next time I’m in Anvil”
That was less exciting than you expected. You’re not quite sure why, but you were kind of hoping to discover some piece of life-changing information in this letter. Or at least something useful.

You weren’t reading someone else’s mail, you were reading someone else’s trash. It’s completely different, and much more acceptable.
But yeah, this is no time to stand around pondering the morality of garbage-tampering. You’ve got work to do. 
First things first, it’s time to head to the trader and sell off all this stuff you don’t need. You know, get a little starter cash, hopefully enough to cover the first day or so. 
After that… you guess you’ve got some options. One thing you definitely want to do before tonight is get a magic recharge from the healers at the chapel – you know, in case the wizardfolk at the Mages Guild ask you to demonstrate your abilities. 
But really, your first priority here should be saving up some cold, hard cash. There were a couple people who seemed like they might be willing to pay. That one guy needed a sign? You could do that, you guess? That’s like a good ten septims probably. Woo, nearly one twentieth your stay covered right there. 
Heh. Yeah. You know you need the money, but you really really really really really really really don’t want to enter that dance tournament. 
I mean, your old life of drunken one-night stands and sleazy poledancing is something you want to leave behind. Now that you’re far away from home, you want to be someone people can look up to. You want to be someone you can look up to. The very thought of getting up on a stage and showing everyone in Kvatch what a trashy slut you are… it just sort of puts a knot in your stomach. The people in this town probably almost kind of respect you right now and you want to hang onto that. Because it feels really good.
So yeah, dance competition isn’t going to happen. Not unless you can miraculously come up with some act that doesn’t make you look like a cheap whore. The orc said it’d be a few days before the next competition, so you guess you’ll have time to think about it.

This, on the other hand, sounds like a perfect idea! Sure, her request seemed a little weird and fetishistic at first, but in retrospect there’s really nothing sexual about licking grape jelly off someone’s neck. It just happens to be a thing she likes, the same way you like magic or Quill-Weave likes chocolate! You are quite sure this lady is a perfectly normal human woman with no ulterior motives whatsoever. You know, no ulterior motives other than the small fact
THAT SHE IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE WHO WANTS TO SUCK YOUR BLOOD.
You’d rather not sell your precious lifeblood to the undead monstrosity. If something bad happens, maybe you get hurt or something, you’re going to need this blood. For bleeding. And you’re not sure how fast people grow new blood. 
Anyway, you’re quite certain you can come up with much better ways to earn money.  
Right, right, no sense in getting frustrated about bad ideas you haven’t even executed yet. Right now it’s time to make some quick cash. A heavier wallet makes everything better. Or so you’ve heard.
You regather your confidence, push the dumb ideas out of your head, and stroll into the Kvatch general store. Tavia welcomes you back and, like before, invites you to look around. She explains that a couple brand new spell scrolls were dropped off since your last visit, if that’s something you’re interested in.

You return Tavia’s greeting and say that spell scrolls are definitely something you’d be interested in. At least perusing them, anyway; right now you really don’t have the money to-

You’ve literally talked to everybody in town, including a cultist, a vampire, and a neckbeard. Don’t pussy out of small talk. He might know of employment opportunities. Networking 101. 
Hold that thought. You suddenly notice the unfamiliar, hooded man standing nearby.
You tell Tavia you’ll get back to her in a minute. You’ve got a friend to make. 
Yeah, the way he’s poring over that shopping list definitely signifies he’s looking for something. You approach the man accordingly.
WHY HELLO there, sir! 
You look like a fellow who is in need of something! Something perhaps easily attainable, that I could help you with?
The man kindly informs you that – as a brighter individual might infer from his priest robe – he’s not in the market for an exotic prostitute. So, bye.
Ignoring the unintentional gut-punch, you scamper after the man and explain that you’re not a prostitute, you’re a wizard! A wizard for hire! You flip your hood up to demonstrate how extremely wizardly you are.
He shrugs and apologizes. He is usually capable of sensing a fellow magic-user. In fact, he always is. Now if you’ll excuse him, Sigrid is expecting some supplies.
Sigrid? Ooh! Are you with the Mages Guild then, you ask? You tell him that you’ve been thinking about joining the guild, and are gonna visit the Kvatch guildhall tonight. It’ll actually be your first visit to a Mages Guild since you learned magic! You’re really looking forward to it, though you’re not sure what to expect. 
What’s the Kvatch Mages Guild like? Is Sigrid the head of it? Are you allowed to read the Guild’s books even if you’re not an actual member yet? Does the guild buy alchemy ingredients? Do you have one of those creepy Cabal guys there? Sorry, are all these questions bothering you? 
Yes, he says, your incessant questioning is the most annoying thing he has ever experienced. 
Oh. Sorry, you say. Dealing with mages and magic stuff… it just always makes you this weird mix of nervous and excited. Eeeee.
Actually, since he’s apparently a mage-priest-thing, maybe he could help you out a little? You explain that you can’t generate your own magicka – Atronach and all – and you really really don’t want to show up at the Mages Guild tonight without any. So maybe, if it’s not too much trouble, he could like… hit you up with a healing spell or something? 
The man tells you not to worry about it. He’ll tell Sigrid you’re coming, mention your magicka problem, and she’ll come up with something. That’s the kind of thing she does. 
Really? That sounds great! Thanks! I’ll see you guys there tonight, I guess?
By the way, for a Mages Guild, is there a required dress code or something? Because I want to make a good impression, and I don’t know how I feel about this hood.
Also my name is Katia! I didn’t catch yours! 
Is it Steve? You look kind of like a Steve! 
Wizards are SO COOL! Eeeeeeee you can’t wait until tonight.

Come on, this is the Mages Guild we’re talking about.
It’s a professional, government-regulated organization of magic-users. It’s not like they’re going to lead you into a dark alley and mug you or anything. You’ll be fine.
Anyway, all this magic stuff is super exciting, but you’ve got a bigger priority right now: earning some money! Wizard or not, you’ve got to show Quill-Weave – and yourself – that you are capable of being a responsible, self-sufficient individual.

That turned out… alright, you guess. 
You were kinda hoping to get at least enough for Quill-Weave’s book, but you can work with this. You’ve just got to find some more jobs you can do, and you’ll be back on budget in no time.
Before leaving the store you ask Tavia about her imp problem, and if she’d possibly be interested in hiring an intrepid young wizard to handle it. She thanks you for the offer, but reiterates that she still wants to give the imps another day to find their own way out. And if that doesn’t work, she’d rather hire a professional. Someone she knows won’t get killed on the job.
You also check in with Hirtel about those one-septim magic books, hoping maybe you can learn a new spell or two before tonight. He says that the restoration tome for Q.W. was his last one, though. The Mages Guild buys most of his magic books, so you’ll have to go bother them. Not him. Shoo.
Ah well. Just more to look forward to about tonight, you guess. You’re trying to keep a positive attitude, and it kind of helps if you keep your mind busy. You know, keep pondering new ways to make some coin.
For instance, you asked Tavia what alchemical ingredients people actually buy. You didn’t recognize most of the things she named, but she did say primrose leaves might be worth a coin or two. 
And even if nothing else works out, pretty soon you’re going to have a regenerating supply of primrose leaves right at your fingertips. 
Yup. You’re still doing fine. Everything’s going to be fine.
NOPE YOU’RE DOING FINE HAHA
ha
Let’s just concentrate on the job hunting.
So let’s dance. Show off our moves. If they think it’s perverted, then THEY are the ones who are perverted. WE are dancing. And if they won’t let us win the competition because they think it’s perverted, again… FUCK THEM. Just another thing to check off the list as having been tried. We will not go through life regretting what we could have done ANYMORE. We’re going to the mages guild, we’re going to better ourselves- if they let us- and by Katia Managen, we’re going to make it this time. OUR WAY.
Haven’t we been over this already?
Look, you’re really trying to forget about that poorly-thought-out poledancing escapade earlier today. Maybe it’s something you would’ve done for money back home, but you’re a wizard now. That means you can make a living in a proper, respectable way you can be proud of. Sure, maybe you shouldn’t care what people think of you, but you do. You want them to see Katia Managan, a person and a wizard. Not some… cheap, subhuman cat-thing doing half-naked flips to pay for its next round of sweet, cold, refreshing mead. 
But… if you’re strapped for cash later, and get some decent magic training tonight, maybe you can come up with an act using magical fire or something. Maybe. You’ve been thinking about it a little. 
You move the dance competition into the “maybe” column, with the stipulation that whatever you do will look classy, respectable, and wizardly. And really cool, so you don’t embarrass yourself. You’ve still got a few days to puzzle something out, if you actually do decide to enter.
Heck, maybe you’ll get lucky and some major event will distract everyone while you’re performing. Heh.
Of course, in the meantime you still have plenty of other options! Lots of opportunities to show everyone how responsible and useful Katia Managan can be.
In particular, you recall meeting a woman who was trying to solve a slaughterfish infestation in one of the wells. Perhaps she’d be willing to pay for some wizardly assistance? Or even if she’s not willing to pay you, perhaps you’ll be able to eat – or even sell – those fish, if you help get them out? 
Sounds like a win-win to you. You head up to the well.
Whew, looks like you showed up just in time to inadvertently save Kvatch!

You just figured it made more sense there, since I mean it’s still a little dubious whether you’ll actually be able to… alright, fine.
You move “succeed in life” to the “Excited-to-do” column. Optimism yaaay.  
Oh, don’t worry, that already has its own column.
>I recommend you try to talk to her, find out if shes already poisoned the well. If not try and talk her out of it, mention how dangerous this is and how hiring a certain cat wizard is much safer. While you talk to her position yourself between her and the well so if she makes a move you can stop her.
Anyway, while sorting your goals into arbitrary categories you have inched your way over to the crazy-poison-lady,  inconspicuously positioning yourself between her and the well.
So hey, you say after a short, uncomfortable silence. What’s with that… bottle of poison you’ve got there?
Oh, this? The woman explains that some slaughterfish got into the well. She’s trying to get rid of them. She thought about poisoning the well to kill them, but then she thought about it harder and realized that would be a really bad idea. So she didn’t do it. 
That’s good, you say. You tell her that for a second you thought she was actually going to – 
-But then, the woman continues, she started thinking about it even harder…
She realized her whole goal was to get rid of those fish. And poison… the poison would do that. It would do a very good job! So poisoning the well couldn’t be a bad idea, could it? If anything, it started to seem as though poisoning the well would be a good idea… with some rough edges. And she started thinking, what if there are no bad ideas, only good ideas with varying degrees of roughness? She was overcome with this terrifying new worldview in which all ideas were inherently good. If that was true, then would poisoning a well really be so bad? 
Maybe… maybe poisoning the well is the best idea. What do you think about it, Katia? 
In the nicest terms possible, you tell the woman that she is probably not the best person to be dealing with wells. How about if you kill those fish for her? You have some ideas of how to handle it. Ideas much safer than poisoning the well.
The woman says that she’d be very appreciative of any help! She says she’s not really the best problem-solver and was actually hoping that someone more qualified would come along and offer to lend a hand. You… you are more qualified, right? A person with qualifications?
Adventurer
Layman Signmaker 
Dedicated deliverywoman
Wizard in training
Master of exotic dancing
Resource gatherer
Barterer
Now isn’t that an impressive list of more or less respectable professions? Yeah, you are allowed to feel a warm and fuzzy feeling over all you have achieved in the short time you have been here.
Qualifications? Psht, not only are you an experienced adventurer, layman signmaker, dedicated deliverywoman, budding wizard, exotic dancer, trained resource gatherer, and vicious barterer, but you are a natural, hunterlike carnivore. Killing fish? Piece of cake. You’ve killed at least two fish this week alone. Almost twice that if you count crustaceans. 
Watch this…
Oh, right. No magicka.
You have some other plans, too. 
That’s good, she says. She looks forward to seeing what you come up with! Maybe she’ll learn a thing or two watching you. 
You ask the woman a series of questions about the well and the fish, but she doesn’t seem to have many answers. All she seems to know is that it’s a well, and there are slaughterfish in it. Using your darkvision, though, you determine that the well goes about twenty feet deep before reaching water, and you spot at least two fish moving around down there.
Hm. With your current inventory, you’re sure you can come up with some way to evict those fish. Hopefully some way that doesn’t involve going climbing into the well. 
Because…
Yeah… getting stuck would actually be the least of your problems if you fell in.
You don’t know how to swim. 

Way ahead of you! 
This contraption you just made should do the trick. The slaughterfish will bite onto the ball gag – which is smeared with fresh Khajiit blood – and then you’ll scoop them up in the bucket. Easy.
I mean, come on, that’s clearly why you made your eyes bleed in the first place. Surely you wouldn’t be stupid enough to turn your darkvision on in broad daylight again.
And what is her personal interest in clearing this well? Clearly the whole city of Kvatch is not dying of thirst, so there must be other sources of water. Is this her well? Does she just really have it in for slaughterfish?
While you wait for a bite, you decide to strike up a conversation with the woman. If she’s trying to clean out the well, you assume she’s a groundskeeper for the Count?
Oh, no, she says. She’s just visiting town. Supposed to meet someone here; very hush-hush, don’t worry about it. It’s just, she heard about the slaughterfish in this well, and thought someone ought to do something about them. Figured… figured she’d try to help out, despite being utterly unqualified, a little clueless, and likely to cause grievous harm to herself or others. 
Ah, yeah, you’ve totally been there before. But don’t worry, you’ve got this under control. 
There’s a bite now! Time to reel it in. Honestly, you don’t see the big deal here. I mean, it’s just some fish in a well. 
Slaughterfish, she corrects you. They hate everything.
Oh. Right. You tell her you read about them in a book once. Though it didn’t actually give any tips on getting rid of them. 
But it’s cool, you have plenty of other ideas! Maybe you’ll, like, harpoon those suckers. Piece of cake.
Ah, this should do it.
You confess you don’t have a very good throwing arm. 
And are maybe not the best spear-crafter. 
Right…
You tell the woman that it looks like you’re going to need magic for this. Which, for you, means finding some spells to absorb. So, um, wait here, and don’t poison the well. You’re gonna shuffle off to the chapel real fast; see if you can get a quick heal or somethi- 
Ah!
Oh. You know healing magic, then?
The woman says the need comes up frequently in her line of work. Too frequently. Think you can take care of those fish now?
Shouldn’t be a problem, you say! Those fish are as good as toast. You tell the woman to stand back while you think up a bunch of derogatory cat jokes to power your magic. 
That should do the trick.
… or not.
You… you do know the fish are underwater, right? The woman says she’s no expert, but she doesn’t think fire works underwater. 
You explain that you were trying to kill the fish by boiling the water. 
The woman asks if you’ve ever boiled water before.
Sure, you say. I mean, a pot over a fire, anyway. Boiling a well can’t be… that much different, right?

Don’t worry, you’ve still got plenty of ideas. You can handle this. Katia Managan can handle this.
Besides getting some fish to eat and scales to sell, this is going to be your way of showing Kvatch that you are a competent and useful individual. Someone who can approach a problem and just straight-up solve it, rather than run crying to someone else.
You tell the crazy poison lady that you’re going to try some different magic. Like, maybe using another element, something that can get you a quick, clean kill even underwater. She says that sounds like a great idea; she really would prefer humane, peaceful kills. If that’s… if that’s something you can actually do. You tell her you’ll try. 
This kitten might need mittens if she’s shooting icicles out of her paws!
She uncomfortably points out that you are still making fire. And it’s still not working.

Bah. These, on the other hand, don’t appear to be doing anything at all.
But you’ve got more ideas! You can do this!
Wait here!
Okay, wow, these fish don’t take shit from any bucket. You’re pretty sure the blacksmith said she didn’t need those pails back, though.
And apparently these fish can bite through rope, too. You didn’t even bait the hook, they just bit it off.
But it’s okay, you’ll still figure this out! 
Now there’s an idea!
Wait here again! And don’t poison the well!
Behold!
Alright, that was a bad shot. You’ve, ah, never used one of these before, and thought it would arc downward more.
You’ve just got to get the right angle…
You apologize for taking so long with this. You explain that you really want to help out, but it’s proving more complicated than you thought. 
The crazy woman sighs and says it’s fine, take your time. She adds something incoherent about how we can’t all be nectarines, though you might’ve misheard that slightly.
Almost hit the water with that last one. 
You thank Menien for lending the bow. He says you don’t have to worry about the arrows, but you insist he take at least two coins for them. You’re trying to wean off using other people for charity. 
Okay, it doesn’t look like that rock killed any fish. But we drop a couple more, one of them probably will. Probably. We can do this. 
In fact, it might take a few more hours, but if we filled the whole well up with rocks it would either bury the fish or suffocate them. But… I guess that would cause an even bigger problem, what with the well being filled with rocks.
You admit you’re starting to think maybe the poison isn’t such a bad idea. Like, maybe you could pour it down the well, and then get an antidote to pour in after it? You ask your new friend if that would work, or if antidotes don’t-
Oh. 
Crazy lady? Hello?
You… guess she left.

Yeah, you confess that you probably could’ve handled that better. Much better.
You just… had this idea that if you kept trying, maybe you’d be able to pull off something cool and spontaneous that would elegantly solve everything. Maybe pierce both fish with one arrow, or shoot a lightning bolt from your fingertips. Something that would make you feel kind of like a hero, rather than a wannabe-wizard using someone else’s magicka to slowly boil water. 
Oh well. Not everyone can be a hero like in the stories, you guess. You make yourself a solemn promise to stick to safe and reliable methods in the future.
Though on the bright side, you apparently did keep the well from being poisoned! Not to mention those fish will probably die a slow, painful death from all the metal hooks moving through their digestive tracts. So even if you got nothing out of it, your actions possibly saved people in the future from suffering indeterminate amounts of harm. Fuck yeah!
You give yourself a celebratory low-five. 
Right then. 
You… guess this job was kind of a bust, and it’s time to just cut your losses and move on. 
You’ve probably still got another hour or so before the Guild opens. Maybe you’ll just… wander around town for a while, or buy a snack. Or hell, maybe even see that vampire so you can at least end the day with enough coin to get Quill’s book if you want. 
You’re still excited about visiting the Guild tonight and you know you’ll feel better once you actually get there, but this whole slaughterfish ordeal has left you feeling kind of melancholy and bummed out. Here was your first real chance to show everyone in town that you’re not just some skill-less nobody. Your first real chance to show them you can actually do things when you put your mind to them. And when you tried, you just… couldn’t. 
Someone more skilled and intelligent than you, they could probably find some way to take care of those fish. They’d probably know some trick that’d make it real easy. But you… you’ve already tried everything you could think of. 
Almost everything.

You cautiously peer down into the well. It’s a long way to the bottom and the water looks deep. You could just walk away. You could just forget about this entirely, or tell a guard to handle it. You could – and probably should – play it safe and just go wait outside the Mages Guild until nightfall. After all, it’s not like anyone will judge you for giving up on a job that was outside your abilities.
But…
If you could just get a little closer to the water, you and your hatchet could probably make quick work of anything down there. You could get those scales, that meat, and maybe even the arrows you just paid for. You could stroll into the Mages Guild tonight a bit more confident, having successfully helped Kvatch in your own small way. You could still  do this.
You won’t deny your motivations probably stretch a bit deeper than that. Maybe it’s all those hours of pussyfooting around and failing to kill those fish, making you all the more determined to get something out of this. Or maybe it’s because someone – no matter how crazy she was – honestly thought you could succeed here, showing a faith in you that only Quill-Weave has ever shared. Or maybe you just have a persistent habit of overestimating yourself as some sort of coping mechanism to help you deal with your blatant ineptitude.
All you know for certain is that when you look down that well and think of all the time you’ve wasted here, you start to wonder: what if you just have to… go a little crazy, and everything you do will turn to gold?

You know knots. More about them than you care to admit, and this rope seems sturdy enough to hold your weight. Also, you used to climb all the time back when you were younger. The stonework out here in Cyrodiil is smoother than what you’re used to, but there’s still nothing to worry about. You know what you’re doing.
Holy shit! 
That’s way better than your idea. 
You… adjust your plan accordingly. Yup. Totally know what you’re doing.
Also, you let Hirtel know that you’re going to dive down a well and kill some fish in melee combat, and tell him to maybe come check on you in a little while. Make sure you’re not drowning. Sure, whatever, he replies. Have fun.

You’re on a tight time limit here, so you rush back to the well, strip down to your slip dress, and stash your valuables in a nearby crate. You quickly review your plan: get down there, deliver some quick swipes until they die from blood loss, scoop up the bodies, and get out. Prove you can do this. Piece of cake, and perfectly safe as long as you stay above the water.
*sighs*

You are now the perfectly normal human female. 
And boy do you smell something delicious. 

Nah.
What fangs? An ordinary human such as yourself doesn’t have fangs, silly! The very thought of such a thing is preposterous, offensive, and utterly unsubstantiated. 
You’d love to check out that rich, bloody scent that popped up all of a sudden…
… but you’re busy playing a game called “don’t leave the tree’s shadow”. You love this game, so much that you’re gonna keep playing until nightfall. The rules say you’re not allowed to leave the tree’s shadow unless you’ve recently drunk something red, such as red herring juice… or even blood. And since you don’t see any red herring juice around here, you guess you’ve got to drink some blood.
You spot a kitten full of blood crossing the lawn a short distance away. You quickly grab some grape jelly out of your grocery bag and attempt to lure the creature toward you. 
It glances at you briefly, then turns and keeps walking. Which is weird, since cats love jelly.
At least you’re pretty sure that’s cats you’re thinking of.

Potion?
POTION? 
Let me tell you a little something about “potions”.
Potions are bullshit overpriced wastes-of-space pushed by those filthy goddamn alchemists. People these days will chug a potion for every little scrape, bruise, or potential burn. With all these potions, you bet the average person doesn’t even know how to tie a bandage anymore. You bet they don’t even care. Thanks to the potion industry, people don’t even know what it’s like to be a real medic.
They’ve never known that joy… that thrill of saving a tent full of unconscious, bleeding soldiers using nothing but a roll of gauze and a bottle of whiskey. That excitement of running out of antidote potions and having to cut a vein and suck the poison out. That alluring exhilaration of wiping the copious blood from a grievous wound while closing it using only a rusty needle and a spool of thread. The very thought makes you salivate… with approval. But no, these days it’s all potions and magic. Potions and magic. They’ve forgotten all about the Finest Art. 
Sure, you might have gotten forcibly discharged from several armies for drinking on the job, but you’ve always been passionate about your field. Someday, people will remember your glorious discipline. Someday war will once again ravage the countryside and there simply won’t be enough potions and magicka to go around. Blood will flow like honey and the alchemists and healers will be overwhelmed. Man and mer alike will be once again forced to solve problems the right way: retroactively, with a blood-soaked apron and a pair of pliers.
It will be beautiful. It will be the third century all over again. 
Not that an ordinary human like you remembers the third century. 
You think you’ve already made your feelings about alchemists fairly clear. 
But you… will reluctantly admit you currently have a certain arrangement with Sigrid.
But that’s Sigrid. 
And it’s something of a necessity. Ever since Kvatch’s last beggar died, there’s been no humans willing to let you lick corn paste off their neck! This inability to satisfy your strange fetish has led to quite a few impromptu games of Don’t Leave The Shadow.

Eh, you’re curious about the tasty smell but you don’t care that much. You’d rather not dump your groceries all over the ground or go clambering up any trees. 
Whatever the smell is, you’re sure it can wait. At this point you’ve only got like an hour left before nightfall, so you figure you’ll just… chillax, maybe catch up on some reading. 
Just gonna finish this page…
Alright, coast seems clear. You put away your ordinary copy of the Black Horse Courier and follow your nose. The odor’s not as strong as it was before, but it’s definitely still there. Let’s see where it takes you. 
Welp. Something happened here.

You usually try not to get involved in people’s personal problems, but vast quantities of fresh blood inform you that this girl is not only the source of the smell, but most definitely in need of medical attention. Specifically your unique brand of ulterior-motive-free medical attention. 
You ask what kind of help she needs. She specifies that she is looking for the pull-me-out-of-a-well kind. You ask if she’s got a good grip. 
She calls back that most of the rope is slippy with blood, but she thinks she can hold on. “I’ve got a dry spot I’m holding onto now. Just… pull me up slowl-”
“Or that… works too.”
You ask Dumbass McWelldiver if she’s alright. 
“I’m fine,” she replies, “just kinda dizzy. I… really have to get to the Mages Guild, though. Something big happened while I was down there, and-”
“Oh. It’s… you. Please don’t drink my blood.”
You laugh heartily at the notion. “Drink your blood? Don’t be ridiculous; humans don’t drink blood! The very suggestion renders me sick to my feeble human stomach. Continuing along this line of inquiry may cause me to vomit up my lunch, which presumably consists of corn and water.”
“Ah, sorry. I mean, I guess I just figured you-”
“Now look at you, you poor baby. Let’s get that wound cleaned up.”
Like any decent professional, you proceed to inquire about the patient’s status. That is to say, you ask her what the hell happened.
“Oh man, I was hoping you’d ask! I gotta tell someone all about this,” Dumbass McWelldiver twitters excitedly. “Okay so at first I was all about getting these fish out of the well, right? Like, I guess sometimes I do this dumb thing where I fail a whole bunch, start monologuing to myself, and then go off on some stupid plan to try to make everything better, and this time I apparently decided I was going to climb down the well which in retrospect wasn’t a very good idea I think, but I left my amulet and stuff up here so I wouldn’t drop it, right? Anyway the dictionary had this picture of something called ‘abseiling’ which I tried to-”
“Woah, woah, there’s an elf down the street who will gladly listen to your life’s story for 30 drakes an hour. I just want to know how a fish got your eye.”

Duhlicious wrote: Katia: Once you’re close enough to the water, use your eye of fear. ForthanEldiar wrote: on second thought, use your eye of fear on the fish!  
“Oh, this, ah… actually had nothing to do with the fish. I kinda… forgot I already did my Eye of Fear thing once today, and when I tried to use it on the fish… yeah. It’ll get better, it’s not important.”
“No, what’s important is what happened after. The eye, hanging upside down bleeding for an hour, failing to get some stupid fish out of a well… none of it even matters. Because… because the best thing happened while I was down there!”

After a couple minutes, Dumbass McWelldiver breaks the silence. “You… do want me to elaborate, right? On the best thing?” You explain that you’re not particularly interested, but she insists it’s the neatest thing ever and you won’t be disappointed. 
“Okay, so I was stuck down there for a while, right? And at first I was really scared, but then to make myself feel a little better I started using the time to experiment. Like, to think about different things, see if I could produce any magical effects. For the most part none of it worked, but it kept me busy so I didn’t care. But then on a whim I decided to retry one of my old ideas, and I noticed something subtle that I missed back when I tried it above ground.”
“Watch this.”
I mean I’m not fishing for trouble, you’re very deer to us after owl, I just notice you bearily hanging in hare so I’d eely like to lend you a hamd. First off it’s a well so it’ll be flippery, hold on tiger beclaws we don’t want ewe to fall in for that woold be an udder disaster and not very fawny. Tuck your tail in a little closer it can toadly be bit off, adder girl! I skink we must be shrewd when dealing with the fish, things can beecome hare-owing quick. Anoa you think I’m just badgering you but you goat to sea I’m not a total loon, I’m trying to kelp you.
“Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee did you see it? Did you see it?” she squeals.
“You made a little fire?”
“That was an accident; I mean right before that! I’m not entirely sure how, but… I think I knocked it over! I pushed it over with my mind! That’s, ah, pretty cool, right?” 
“Sure, kid. Everyone will gather around and be completely awestruck at your ability to magically push things over.”
She rolls her eyes at your sarcasm. “Pft, I guess I can’t expect a plebeian like you to appreciate awesome wizard stuff.”
“But still… a second spell. It’s not much, but if I can do it on command that should be enough for me to actually join the Mages Guild! I mean, assuming I can pass that physical strength requirement this time. But I did get some pretty good arm exercise climbing down into the well. And if that’s still not enough, maybe I can sneakily use my new spell to constantly knock up whatever they ask me to lift. I mean, ‘knock up’ in the sense that I am literally knocking it upward, not… yeah.”
“Sorry, I’m thinking out loud,” she says timidly as she gets to her feet. Her knees are a bit shaky, but you’ve got her bandaged up so she should heal and refill quickly. “I’m just kinda excited. What I really mean to say is, well, I guess I kind of owe you a lot. You know, for helping make this my best day ever, rather than my last day. So… thanks, I guess. Thanks for saving me.”
“Aaand?” you ask with anticipation.
“For licking me clean like a cat?”
“Aaaaand?”
“For… wrapping me up in spongey tape, for some reason?”
You are now Katia Managan again.
That vampire sure was weird! 
But whatever, you guess this stuff will keep your blood in until you can find a healing potion. 
Yeah yeah, don’t worry! You don’t need dumb heroics anymore. Once you get accepted into the Guild you’ll have a place to stay and food to eat and people who accept you and nothing to worry about! You’ll finish Quill-Weave’s job, learn a bunch of spells, and never disappoint anyone ever again. 
Things are gonna be great. Things are finally gonna be great.

You gather up your belongings and confirm everything important is still there. Quill-Weave’s package, the money, your amulet… everything looks good to go. You’re ready to head off to the Mages Guild.
Right now, time is one of your limited resources. You’re kinda hyped about this whole wizard thing and want to get to the Guild as soon as possible. The wizards there should have some healing spells if you need them, so there’s no sense in wasting time at the church. 
A little magic practice couldn’t hurt, though. On the way over to retrieve your axe you take another swing at the new spell. You haven’t reduced it to a science yet, but it seems to have something to do with non-cat burns? 
Hopefully you won’t flounder like a fish out of water when it comes time to show it off. 
It’s not much, but still… this is a pretty big development. With two spells, you should have enough to pass the Guild’s entry requirements. Things are moving a lot faster than you anticipated; soon you’re going to have a place to stay and food to eat and books to read and friends to talk to…
You’re gonna be a wizard! The thought sends a chill up your spine.
Well… okay, you admit you’re kinda jumping the crossbow a bit. You guess there’s still a zillion ways this could backfire disastrously, probably resulting in you not only getting turned down but making a total fool of yourself in front of everyone. Maybe you’ll set your tail on fire, or run out of shitty puns at a crucial moment, or just freeze up as soon as they ask you to show your skills. 
But… you think you’ve earned the right to get your hopes up a little. There’s a chance that you, Katia Managan, could literally be a card-carrying Mages Guild member by the end of today. Even if it’s not guaranteed, it’s a very real chance. It feels good to think about that. That your biggest success yet could be right around the corner.
And if it doesn’t work out… you’ll be disappointed, sure, especially after getting your hopes up. But you’ll deal with it. You’ll buy a room at the inn, score dinner out of someone’s candy bowl, and resume your job-hunting as usual tomorrow. And if sad feelings strike and you start to feel like the only answer is to drown your sorrows in a bottle of whiskey, well…
You won’t.
But this is no time to worry about failure! You’ve got a Guild to join! You restore your giddiness with a wicked air-lute solo. 
Gonna be a wiiiizaaaaaaaard!
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Come on, we’ve been over this. The Mages Guild is a reputable, empire-wide professional organization dedicated to the study and application of magic. You’re sure the Kvatch chapter is no exception. In fact, from what you’ve heard around town it sounds like they might be one of the best. There’s nothing to be worried about.
You’re sure there’s nothing shady or weird going on at the Kvatch Mages Guild!
Positive.

While you’d certainly like to flip through some books before dinner, it doesn’t look like you’ll have a chance. Sigrid grabs your shoulder and swiftly ushers you into the next room. 
Just look at you, she says! Scraggly fur, pale nose… you look positively famished! Let me guess, been out on some magical adventures? Traveling Tamriel, seeking fame and fortune?
Kind of, you say.  You’ve actually just sort of been running errands all day, but it’s kept you pretty busy. You admit you kinda haven’t actually eaten or drank anything since this morning.
Sigrid grins warmly. We’ll have to fix that, then! Come, have a seat. Oh, and careful not to slip on the flowers. I keep telling people to leave them off to the side of the walkway, but, well, you know…
People.
Something to drink? Sigrid explains she has a couple of her specialty drinks mixed. She’s got Applepear Surprise – which is made from pears and apples mashed together. She’s got Holiday Punch – made from a mix of ham and lettuce. Aaaaand she’s got a pitcher of melted cheese mixed with more cheese. She hasn’t come up with a name for that one yet.
Ah… all virgin, you ask?
As a Redguard who can’t swing a sword, she replies. 
You opt for Applepear Surprise, being the only one that sounds remotely like a beverage. Sigrid commends you on the choice, and says it’s her personal favorite too.
You smile uneasily and thank her for the drink. She tells you to wait here – she’s going to grab the rest of the meal and join you in a moment. It’s been so long since she’s met a real, traveling mage, she looks forward to hearing all about you!

Large alchemy laboratory.
Unusually alluring and friendly lady in charge.
Come to conclusion.
With Sigrid out of the room, you take a moment to assess the situation.
A few of the things you saw downstairs were… unsettling, sure. But you don’t want to jump to any conclusions just yet. I mean, there still might be a perfectly reasonable explanation. After all, this is still the Mages Guild, and Sigrid herself seems nice enough. You suspect there’s probably nothing to worry about. 
Fangs? You’re pretty sure those were just the regular, nubby little fangs most humans have. Pretty sure.
You guess they looked a little pointy, but… nothing to be concerned about, probably.
Just to be safe, you glance around the room and note your potential escape routes. It’s a long way to the front door, but you guess you could always go for the window and…
Oh, don’t mind me, Sigrid says. Just handling some security stuff. Wouldn’t want an imp flying through the window and crashing our meal now, would we? 
Heh, no, you say. That would be terrible. 
In an attempt to curb your implacable feeling of impending doom, you cautiously bring up one of the most pressing questions on your mind. So, ah, Miss Sigrid? I can’t help but maybe notice that there are a lot less people here than I expected. Like, the whole place really seems sort of… empty.
Sigrid confesses the Kvatch guildhall has been a little barren since the Necromancy ban. Most Guild mages still view the place with a bit of a stigma. Archmage Traven won’t even give us funding, she says. As far as he’s concerned, this whole building is permanently evil.
But I’ve been working on turning things around! I’ve been doing some renovations, restocking the library, and trying to restore the Guild’s reputation with the citizens of Kvatch. You know, showing everyone that not all mages are evil, soul-stealing necromancers. It’s hard work, but very rewarding!
It does get a little lonely sometimes, holding the place down on my own.  But I do what I can to make it as inviting as possible. To remind everyone that there’s still a Kvatch Mages Guild, and that everyone is welcome here.
Ah! For instance, I see you’ve noticed my ethnic diversity mural! 
I had it painted last month. One of my many attempts to brighten this place up a little.
A pretty successful one, I think? I bet you feel more at home here already.

Squiggles – priceless work of art

You, ah…
You tell Sigrid that you like the colors. It contains all your favorite ones, somewhere. 
Ah, thank you! It was no easy task mixing all those pigments – nor finding a painter who could integrate all of them so well! Without a doubt, best hundred thousand septims I’ve ever spent. 
Anyway, looks like the breadsticks are finally here! I hope you don’t mind chatting over dinner? We don’t get many other mages in town. 
1) From what Sigrid is claiming, the mage’s guild has been in previous hands. Necromancer hands. That all up and left the place in an uproar. That room in the basement and the materials? Most likely left behind by those necromancers. She’s probably the only one left who chose NOT to leave and turn things around.
2) The weird flowers, the deer, the mural? The fact she uses the alchemy lab to make dinner and mixed drink experiments? Sigrid is nice, but trying to do everything at the same time. She’s scattered. From what you can see, Sigrid is eccentric, but hasn’t done anything bad to hurt you or steer you wrong as of yet. She’s got this whole reverse necromancy fung shui thing going on.
3) There are imps in the city. That would be your fault. She’s locking the window for a valid reason, kitty.
4) To get back to the chained up, bloody door in the basement? What if that isn’t her fault? She might just be telling you to stay away from it because its full of horrid abominations left behind from those nasty Necromancers. There’s a building full of imps across the way (Nice going by the way) because of another errant mage’s exploits. Don’t go blaming her.
While Sigrid and her friend head to their seats, you take a deep breath and try to let some of your worries melt away. Sure, you guess there’s still a chance she could be an evil necromancer vampire planning to kill you, but it’s starting to look less and less likely. If anything, it kind of sounds like she’s just a misunderstood wizard trying to make as many friends as possible. 
And that’s something you can relate to. A lot.
So, ah, hi! I’m Katia Managan, you say. 
I know, Sigrid says. You already introduced yourself.
Oh, sorry, you say. I’m not very good at conversations. 
Sigrid says it’s fine, sometimes she likes to introduce herself several times in a row as well.

Hi! Remember me? We met earlier today. We were in the general store, and I-
He cuts you off and assures you that if you were anyone worth remembering, he would have said something.
Sigrid lets out a long sigh. I see you’ve had the pleasure of meeting Stephane. He works at the chapel so he’s not an active Guild member, but he still drops by to keep me company. Don’t mind his douchiness; being a Breton, he’s probably just huffy at the idea he might be the third best mage in this room.  
Oh! Ah, him, third best? You’re flattered at the insinuation, you say, but there’s pretty much no chance you’re a better mage than he is. I mean, you just started practicing recently, and you don’t know many spel-
Sigrid says there’s no need for modesty. You’re an Atronach. Even if you only started with magic recently, she suspects you’ve been taking to it like a fish to water. With some proper reference books and a bit of practice she’s confident your abilities would exceed people like Stephane in no time – if they haven’t already. 
Oh! You mutter a nervous “thank you”, quickly reaching for your cup to hide the huge smile spreading across your face. You’re trying to keep a professional demeanor, but… well, that’s more praise than you’re accustomed to receiving. At least for anything you wanted to be praised for.
Also, this is basically just a cup of applesauce. 
Tastes okay, though.
With a brightened mood and renewed enthusiasm, you delve straight into some questions.
So, um, since necromancy is apparently banned now, what does the Kvatch guildhall do? I mean, well, what does it specialize in?
Sigrid shrugs. Oh, a bit of this, a bit of that. She admits she’s never really been one for specialization, and thinks it’s important to teach a little of everything. Personally, she’s dabbled in every type of magic; alchemy, alteration, conjuration, illusion, destruction, mysticism, necromancy, restoration…
Not to imply that I’m mediocre at them all, she adds hurriedly. She still considers herself a damn good mage. For example, I could probably kill you right now without even getting up from my seat. I mean, if I had to, y’know, in dire circumstances. Probably.
Yeah, that’s, uh. I can totally respect that. I’m not the best, I know that. Not yet. I have a long way to go, lots to learn, and that’s after I join the Guild and so on.
Sigrid snickers at your reaction. So, do you have any particular magic discipline you’re interested in?
I’m, ah, not really sure yet, you say. You emphasize that you’re really new to this; you haven’t even really learned what’s out there. But you’re looking.
You pick up your cup and take another tongueful of pear-applesauce. You have to admit, this place is kind of growing on you. Sigrid seemed a little suspicious at first, like maybe she was up to something, but you guess you’re starting to see why people admire her. She’s nice to talk to. Like, you get the impression she really does appreciate your presence. 
Though her jokes are kind of lame and her bragging is maybe a little irritating.

… buuuuut overall I’d say it was one of my more enjoyable experiences, if only because I walked away from it relatively fluent in Dragonish. I mean, mostly kind of dirty Dragonish, but I can still do some basic sentences and stuff. 
For a moment you are worried you might have gone into too much detail, but Sigrid merely laughs and says it’s a fascinating story. Though, she was trying to ask if you experimented with magic at all before you moved to Cyrodiil.
Oh! Whoops. Ah, not really, you explain. I mean, when I was younger I always wanted to learn spellcasting, but the local mages mistook my birthsign as some kind of incurable disease and I spent most of my life thinking I could never use magic. But even then, I guess I was still kind of interested in it. I would read a lot of books, stuff like the Feyfolken series, and just sort of try to figure out how the magic worked, or imagine what it would be like to actually use it. Fantasize about a world where everyone saw me as some kind of great wizard, rather than as Hammerfell’s easiest talking animal.
Sigrid nods. Most folks out west never even learn about birthsigns, and it’s a terrible shame that you went so long without understanding your abilities. But she has to say, it’s also incredibly admirable how you kept studying magic even when you thought it was impossible for you to ever learn it. You don’t find many mages with that kind of dedication.
You thank her, and tell her that means a lot coming from a fellow magic-user. I mean, you’re not sure if you’d call it “studying”, reading fiction books about wizards, but… well, it kept you happy, you guess. Right now you’re just really excited that your old dreams are finally coming true.  
You smile and take another bite of bread. Tonight is turning out pretty great. A part of you is starting to feel like maybe, just maybe, you’ve finally found where you belong.
And that feels better than all the booze in the world.
Look, I’m not trying to keep you from making friends, honest. I would love nothing more than for you to have ALL the friends, even the weird vampire-ish ones that want to lick jelly off your neck, as long as it was a not-getting-Katia-killed sort of friendship. 
HOWEVER!
The meal is barely underway and she’s already got you wrapped around her finger–you went from extremely suspicious to downright chummy in mere minutes! Add to that the obvious misanthrope Stephane bending over backwards for her, and it’s starting to seem as though Sigrid’s charm may not be entirely natural.
Yeah, sure, because it’s that hard to believe someone is actually being nice to you.

Speaking of which, if you don’t want your fangs to get a lot bigger over the next three days, you should see if Sigrid can give you a Cure Disease potion, just in case. 
Anyway…
So Sigrid! I was meaning to ask: how did you know about my birthsign? Did I do something to tip you off, or…?
This guy, she says. Thank this guy right here. He stopped by earlier today and said we’d be getting an out-of-town visitor – an atronach short on magicka – and to prepare something accordingly.
Oh! Thank you, Stephane. And, ah, did you? Prepare something, that is? 
Right in front of you, Sigrid replies. That dark blue dipping sauce is a mushroom paste with ground flax; it should charge your magicka up sufficiently.  Oh, and if you want to help that eye heal faster, consider trying some of the aloe-spiced venison spread. There’s not much there since I was running out of cured venison, but it should still speed your recovery up a smidgen.
Ah! Thank you, you tell Sigrid. You had no idea any of these sauces were magic.
She says it’s one of the many perks of being a master alchemist. Our meals become very interesting. 
And, ah, not to sound greedy, but do you maybe have anything for curing diseases? I had a run-in with a vampire on the way here and, you know, would rather play it safe than the undead-equivalent-of-sorry. 
Hmm. Sigrid says she doesn’t have anything prepared, but curing diseases is simple enough…
There. Just lick this thing’s foot.
Like that?
Yup! You no longer have any diseases, Sigrid says. That’s the power of ALCHEMY! 
You thank her, and say that’s certainly a… creative way to cure a disease. You guess she doesn’t have a normal curing spell?
Sigrid says she does, but this way is much funnier. Assuming you can get someone to actually go along with it.

Yeah, you think you might be falling in love with this place. It’s lighthearted, it’s educational, and it’s seeming a lot less creepy now that you understand what’s going on here. Sigrid seems really nice, and she’s already seen your two spells – if only in the form of you heating some chocolate sauce and trying to flop a breadstick into it. You think it may be time to pop the question.
The joining question.
Miss Sigrid, you’ve done an amazing job restoring this guildhall and also you are a wizard and therefore awesome. Would you perhaps be willing to maybe accept a new member? Into the Mages Guild?
Sigrid freezes, seemingly taken off-guard by your question. You… want to join the Mages Guild? Here?
Assuming that’s alright? You tell Sigrid that you really like it here and you’re looking for a place to stay the next couple days. And you’re willing to help out however is needed, with whatever is needed. If she’s okay with getting a new member, that is.
Sigrid’s demeanor suddenly seems more concerned than before.
I… I don’t know! This is so… unexpected! The last time we even had another mage visit here was when the Cabal guy came for the mural. And now we may be getting a member? Steph, do we even have the stuff for a new member?
Yes, he replies.
Are you sure? I mean, getting our first member is a big deal, we want to make sure it goes perfect! We’ll need to get you a copy of the charter, a beginner’s alembic, maybe a complementary silver dagger… and that’s not even counting whether or not we have any beginner-level books on disciplines you’re interested in!

chimericWilder wrote: > Katia, say that its fine, you really wont need most of that immediately. Peterdivine wrote: Considering how many times you’ve been forced to “settle” with nothing, you’re really, REALLY not going to mind if you settle for less.
You interrupt Sigrid and tell her it’s fine, you don’t actually need all that. You’ll be happy just reading whatever books she has in her library, or using whatever equipment she has on hand. Really, you’re not choosy. You’ve been wanting to study magic since you were a little girl and are perfectly willing to settle for a bit less if it means getting started as soon as possible.
Sigrid explains that it’s not just about what you want, it’s also about the Kvatch guildhall’s reputation. She already deals with a lot of discrimination due to the place’s necromantic history; she doesn’t want to risk becoming known as the guildhall that leaves its new members underprepared. A silver dagger and some basic alchemy equipment might not seem important, but it’s part of the standard supplies most Mages Guild branches give their new members. If she provides any less than that to her first applicant, her superiors are going to notice. And imagine what it would do to your status as a mage if everyone thought you came from some second-rate guildhall that couldn’t even give its members proper apparatuses. 
Oh. The thought of potentially damaging your wizard-reputation hits a nerve. You admit you didn’t actually think of it that way.
Sigrid says it’s alright. Most people never think about what it takes to lead a guildhall. She just wants to make sure whatever happens is best for you, her, and the Guild. 
Snow wrote: >Katia: Let Sigrid know you’re REALLY excited to join the Mages Guild and that you REALLY REALLY like this guild hall and it would be an honor and a privilege to join it… and that you’ll do whatever it takes. However if Sigrid feels uncomfortable with accepting a new member right now, you’ll be in town for a few days so she has time to think it over. You can also help her gather anything she might need if it’ll help. Funderful wrote: Katia: Offer to get some supplies if she is missing any.  She has the money for it, and it would be a good initiation into the guild.
You tell Sigrid that you are still holding out hope that you can make this work somehow. You really really do like this place and if you could find some way to join tonight, it would pretty much make it the happiest, most magical day of your life. 
You point out that she does have a large pile of money over there. You don’t want to impose, but couldn’t she just, like, go purchase the stuff she needs to accept you? You’ll even go get it for her, if she’s too busy to do it herself. You’re willing to help however you can.
Sigrid appreciates the offer, but says it’s not that simple. Most of that gold already has places it needs to go and things it needs to pay for. Maintaining a guildhall is an expensive affair; providing magic services for the townsfolk takes equipment, alchemical ingredients, magic items… and without the Archmage’s support, she has to pay for it all out of her own pocket. 
While she wants nothing more than to make this the best guildhall in all of Cyrodiil and induct all the young and enthusiastic mages such as yourself, she just can’t quite afford it yet on her existing budget. I mean, my alchemy business covers some of the expenses, but currently most of our equipment and funding comes from…
Donations.

So what I’m getting here is that “donations” is a euphemism for a prostitution ring, or possibly for an elaborate operation where you kill criminals and take their money?
What? No, Sigrid says, she’s just talking about regular, voluntary donations from people who support what she is trying to do. People who come in here, look around, and decide they want to help the Kvatch Mages Guild get back on its feet. You know…

Oh!
Well, you tell Sigrid you do like this place, and what she’s done with it is very respectable, but you’re not really in any position to donate money right now. I mean, if she needs help with any errands you’d be happy to oblige, or if she –
Sigrid cuts you off and says if you’re short on coin, there are plenty of other things the Guildhall needs. Maybe you’ve got some unusual alchemical ingredients you never use?

Just your amulet, you say, and you need that to keep from starting fires.
A dimebag of moon sugar, perhaps?
You explain that you only tried it once, and it turned out you were allergic.

This direction is starting to make you very, very uncomfortable.
You thank Sigrid for the meal and her hospitality but say you should probably be leaving now, before it gets… too much darker outside.
Sigrid notices your discomfort and tells you to hold on. She apologizes, and admits that she was maybe pushing a little too hard with the donations thing.  
Yeah, you tell her, she kinda was.
She says she didn’t mean to scare you off, she just wanted to make sure you knew what sort of resources the Guild could use. Most people give something after she’s had a chance to talk to them, but there’s no obligation to do so. Everyone is welcome here, whether they donate or not. If you’re willing to stick around a bit longer, she was just about to serve dessert. We’ve got ice cream!
You ask what flavor. 
Strawberry, she says. 
You tell her your interest is piqued.
You confess your reaction was probably a bit unwarranted. When she started asking about all the stuff you were carrying, you guess you were kinda worried she was going to mug you or something.
Sigrid says it’s fine, she realizes she probably could’ve approached the topic better. She assures you that, like all Mages Guild branches, this place is run lawfully and by-the-book. She would never, ever take something from a visitor without their permission. 
Yeah, you say. Mages are pretty cool about stuff like that, you don’t even know why you were worried.
Anyway, she’s gonna go get that ice cream now. Wait here.
Sigrid says you look very pretty and asks if she can have all your stuff.
You ask her if this is enough stuff, or if she needs you to get more.

Don’t be silly! Sigrid wouldn’t ask you to do something that would sabotage your friendship with Quill-Weave. Sigrid is way too nice to do something like that. If anything, Quill-Weave is going to be thrilled to hear all about how you helped the Mages Guild. And how amazing Sigrid is. 
Sure, asking for all your belongings might seem a little weird, but Sigrid made a pretty good case for it. You are confident she knows what she is doing.

Sigrid presses the amulet against your chest and tells you it might be best if you hang onto it. You tell her she’s probably right.
You apologize for the fires; you’re not sure what came over you there. It’s like this little voice in the back of your head is totally flipping out for some reason and trying to get you to run out of here. Sigrid says you should probably disregard that voice. Yeah, you say, she’s probably right. Anyway, hopefully this donation is still sufficient, even without the amulet?
Sigrid admits it is a bit less than she was expecting, especially from someone as well-dressed as you. Your robe is lovely, by the way.
Oh! You thank Sigrid, and tell her you just got it yesterday. You like it a lot. Sigrid says she likes it too, and asks you to give it to her.
You happily oblige. She’s a little shocked at how fast you managed to undress, but you explain that it’s kind of a skill you have. Or more of a liability, really. Sigrid says she understands.
You love how Sigrid understands everything you say. It feels great to finally have someone who  gets you.
While signing some paperwork confirming that all your belongings were voluntarily donated, you ask Sigrid if there’s any additional jobs the Guild needs help with. Sigrid tells you there’s still plenty of materials the guildhall needs; if you ever run into anything valuable, don’t be afraid to come by here and drop it off! We can’t take on any new members just yet, but if you keep donating we may be able to start soon! You tell her you’ll do everything you can to help.
You thank Sigrid again for the meal and all the help she has given you. You now understand why everyone here likes the Kvatch Mages Guild so much. You feel like you’ve made a very valuable friend. Sigrid says she made a new friend tonight as well, and that friend is you. Your heart practically leaps with joy.
Oh! And there’s that strawberry ice cream! 
You ask Sigrid if you can have some. She says no. You tell her that’s alright; if only one of you can have ice cream, you’re glad it’s her.
You have a really good feeling about all these decisions you just made!

With Sigrid gone, you take a couple minutes to calm down and collect your thoughts.
You made some really good progress tonight.  You got a full meal, a new wizard-friend… but most importantly, you feel like you’ve finally found a place where you belong. A place where people believe in you. It’s the greatest, most heartwarming feeling you’ve ever had.
And it’s all thanks to Sigrid. You can understand why everyone in Kvatch is so fond of her.
Huh? Sigrid might be awesome and know a lot of magic, but you’re pretty sure you would’ve noticed if she used some kind of charm on you. The only spell she cast at you tonight was a quick frost spell on your tail, after it caught on fire.
Other than that… she was just really nice to you. Like, really nice. She said things that made you feel like you’re not just some worthless piece of trash. Things that made you feel important. There was this one compliment – you can’t remember exactly what it was – but you swear it made you feel like the most amazing person in the world. 
“You’re pretty” sticks in your mind for some reason, but you suspect it was something more substantial than that. You’ve gotten that much from drunken sailors.

You only gave her what was fair.  
You don’t remember the exact words that were exchanged, but you both agreed that the amount was fine. Sure, she took a lot, but you remember she had some really good justification for it. She could probably explain it again if you went back inside.

Even though there was obviously enough ice cream for you to have a little bit. Doesn’t this seem a little strange? I mean, you promised Quillweave that you would do something very important to her, and you ended up giving everything to a woman you just met. StormyDragon wrote: Katja> Think of the disappointed look on Quill Weave’s face if you fail to bring back her letter and book.
You… really really really don’t want to let Quill-Weave down again. 
But it’s okay, that’s not going to happen. Quill-Weave won’t be disappointed in you. You remember there was some reason she wasn’t going to be disappointed. I mean… you did give away her package, but there was some reason that was okay. Some reason it didn’t matter.
You don’t remember exactly what. It must have been something complicated that Sigrid explained to you. 
But… you know you had had some reason.
That bitch took all your stuff!

Right! Right. No need to panic. Sigrid was… she was probably just trying to show off her wizard powers! Or… maybe this was a test! She was fucking with your mind and wanted to see whether you could break free of it. And you did! You’ll show this to her, she’ll be impressed, you’ll get your stuff back, and everything will be fine.
Everything will be okay.
You bang on the door and yell that this isn’t funny anymore! It was a neat trick, but that was everything you owned in the world and you really need it back now! You need everything to be okay!
There’s no reply. You shout until your throat is sore and there’s still no reply. 
You don’t have inherent Khajiiti skills! You can barely walk across cobblestone without stepping on a squeaky floorboard! And your lockpick was in your bag along with Quill-Weave’s package, your money, your hatchet, your journal, and everything else you gave to Sigrid. 
But… you can fix this. You’re a wizard and you’re resourceful and you’re desperate and angry and upset and you’re sure you can find some way to get in there and get your stuff back.

At the very least, you don’t have to let Quill-Weave down again. There’s still that other letter, the one you threw away. Quill-Weave never has to know you are the worst courier ever and gave away the package you were supposed to deliver. She never has to know there was a package. You can keep it a secret from everyone forever and everything will be fine; you just have to run back to the bookstore and get the old letter out of the trash, hopefully before someone empties the wastebasket or-

Just try forget what has been done to you today.
Wowie gee! As soon as you open the chapel doors Sigrid pops out with a freshly cleaned robe, pile of treasure, and your official Mages Guild membership certificate. She proclaims this was all just a big test to make sure you were ready to join the Guild.
And now that you’ve passed, everything is going to be okay. You curl up by the warm fireplace and relax. It turns out you just had to keep trying, keep believing in yourself, and everything finally came together. Everything finally worked out.
What, this bottle? Yeah, you’re not even sure why you picked it up. 
You cooly toss the bottle to the ground and let it shatter to a million pieces. Katia Managan is brave and successful and doesn’t need to get plastered out of her mind to forget what a failure she is. When the going gets tough, she’s fine because she knows everything will get better eventually.
She knows everything will be okay.
Useless Cat: get the bottle. Check to see if there is some sweet, sweet alcohol in there. Good ol’ alcohol. Alcohol never judges. Alcohol never lets you down.  Alcohol never steals all your stuff and leaves you naked in the rain. You love alcohol, and you know what? Alcohol loves you! If there is indeed alcohol in there, drink it. You know it’s what you need right now.
Yes! You want to down this whole bottle and get wasted to bits. You want to stumble naked into the nearest building and do who-knows-what to what-knows-who and forget about it all the next morning. You want to wake up filled with regrets and ready to drown them out again. You found this bottle and it’s yours fair and square and pretending things will get better just isn’t working and after tonight you think you damn well deserve it! You feel sad, cheated, and just want this day to finish up on its own so you can pick up the pieces when you’re good and ready.
But you made yourself a promise and even if you wouldn’t have made it if you had known what was coming you don’t want to let everyone down again and it feels awful. Your mind is racing with at least three dozen pages worth of thoughts and feelings and plans and fantasies pulling you every which way and you don’t need that right now. You just want to feel better. You just want things to be okay. 
You choke back a fresh wave of tears and take slow, deep breaths. You can still fix this. You’re stronger this time and don’t need to drink. This is a setback but you can still pull through. All the bad feelings, they’re just the prequel to something good. You’ll see.
But the more you think about it, the less true it feels. You just wanted to have one person believe in you by showing her you could do one simple job. Now, at best you’ll only be a slight disappointment. Just like every other time, you’ll have to go on knowing that no matter how hard you try, you’re still worth a little less than everyone else. If even that. 
You tell yourself you just… have to shake that feeling. Find some way to make the future feel bright and giddy again, and quell that black claw gripping at your heart.
Clothes! You’ll go find some. 
Yeah, you can’t control the rain. You can’t control other people. But you damn well could’ve kept yourself from skipping starry-eyed into a creepy building because oooh, mages! You could’ve left at any point. Maybe if you weren’t so useless you could’ve even done something about it. Broken in through a window and stolen your stuff back, or found evidence to convict Sigrid of a crime. Even if the town guards aren’t under her control, they’re not going to believe the word of some dirty slutcat. You know they never did back home.
Or how about this: maybe you could’ve concentrated on your one, simple delivery task rather than getting lost in some dumb wizard fantasy. Maybe if you had gotten the stars out of your eyes long enough to actually listen to the mages you met you would’ve noticed no one was taking you seriously to begin with. Realized you’re a fucking Khajiit who can’t even make magicka, almost twenty years old and can barely start fires – something any fucking mage could do with the exception that you have to wear a goddamn leash to keep from accidentally burning the fucking town down. Maybe you could’ve had an uncharacteristic moment of lucidity and noticed mages are just another shitheap of uncaring bastards looking to fuck you over and throw you away like every other goddamn person you ever tried to care about.
THIS BARREL IS EMPTY WHY ARE YOU EVEN SEARCHING IT?
One thing. You wanted one thing and you were too much of a fucking idiot to realize it was hopeless and pointless and bound to ruin everything. Stuck on some childish idea that you could be anything, do anything, and just be some selfish bitch that’s never happy with what she has. Fuck, you don’t even know what you’re mad at anymore, you just hate yourself and everything you ever ruined for yourself and everyone and want to stop thinking about what a worthless mindless thoughtless imbecile you are. You just want to stop fucking thinking about it.
mysticalMechanic wrote: Do you seriously have any real reason left to not get completely drunk? Hardly. TheUrbanMoose wrote: Alcohol may or may not be the only way out of this. 
Right. Alright. You have to think about this logically. Alcohol is a potential solution here. An effective one! One bottle, everything feels better. The worries, the sadness, the self-loathing, even if just for a night, it goes away. You can feel good again.
But then you’re just running away. It will cause problems, and then in the morning these problems will still be there, and you’ll have to deal with them. But you will have had a good, care free night’s sleep and be totally ready to deal with all the problems ever, tomorrow. That sounds great! It’s booze time. Booooooze o’clock.
But… maybe you’re just saying that because you’re an alcoholic. Maybe you have a problem. I mean, you know you have a problem, but maybe things will actually get better if you quit. I mean, things probably would have gotten better if you had quit earlier. If you hadn’t spent years drinking nightmares away, you could’ve done something. Maybe you could’ve become a merchant, or an alchemist, or an armorer. You would’ve been scared at night, sure, but wake up to a happy life every morning. Maybe if you didn’t have the option to hide your face in a bottle you would’ve gotten over your phobias entirely. Maybe alcohol ruined everything!
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
You apologize to the bottle, you didn’t mean to hurt its feelings and you know it’s just looking out for you and
Fuck fuck FUCK you’re talking to a bottle! You need a drink. You need a not drink. You’re a mess.
KATIA.  QUIT DOING WHAT OTHERS TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.  DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. 
Right. Up to you. You decide your first course of action pretty quickly.
You drop onto the chapel floor and just cry. You cry and cry because you’re stupid and easy and can’t fix anything no matter how hard you try. You cry because your best is worse than everyone else’s average. You cry because your parents never loved you and you’re a disappointment to everyone, even yourself. You cry because all you wanted was to be someone and that’s never going to happen. And when that’s done, you cry a little more because you’re ashamed of being such a crybaby. 
You try to get all the emotions out, try to clear your mind and maybe, just maybe feel ready to tackle the night ahead of you, feel as though this is the time you finally turn things around. But no matter how hard you try, how hard you weep and bawl and try to get it all out, you’re still just a fuckup. No matter what you try, that knowledge is still there, gripping onto your every thought and reminding you that things are never going to change. 
You’re not strong. You’re not a hero. You’re not even worthy of the name Katia Managan. You’re sad and angry and nothing makes sense, but you know this is probably the clearest your head is going to get. 
Someday, things are going to get better. Someday, you are going to fight and persevere and everything will feel great. You think. 
But for now, you know what you have to do.
And at the very least, there is no way you could possibly make yourself feel any worse.

It’s been that intense before, yeah. 
The king has changed into scarier things, you’ve been trapped in worse situations, and – as of yesterday night – you guess you’re no stranger to being violently eviscerated. 
But… that’s the first time something in the dream has ever tried to communicate with you.

It looks like you’re still in the chapel.
The place is a little scorched and wrecked up, but it doesn’t look much worse than the last time you saw it. You guess the fires went out when you lost consciousness.
You’re fine, other than a little burnt fur. 
You apparently got some mail.
“SO YOU’RE A DIRTY BEGGAR”
It goes on to explain the Thieves Guild’s pro-beggar stance and how they’ve left you a free** food bag (food not included). 
“Heeeey kid ~
I have certainly never met you before, but I stuck some oranges and cheese into your little bag thing. These foods have many health benefits, such as helping to more quickly regenerate lost blood. You should probably eat them.

PS. also I left you a pouch of cilantro. I don’t want to be picky but the next time you are going to sleep in a public place maybe you could just sort of swallow that a couple hours beforehand. Thanks.
PPS. also I changed your bandages.”
“DO NOT TOUCH THIS
It is a cultist.

Honestly, you just feel… kind of numb. 
You fucked up. You lost everything you earned, were discarded by the people you looked up to most, gave away the package you were supposed to be delivering to pay your friend back, completely lost control of your powers, and after passing out naked in a church have probably ruined any chance you might have had at a good reputation in Kvatch. You were a wreck last night when this was all happening, but now… you guess it just feels like you’ve run out of sad. You’re just confused.
But hey, you’re still alive. You didn’t burn to death in your sleep. And, congratulations, you’re two days sober.
After that, review priorities:
1. Get clothes.
2. Get replacement letter to give back to Quill-Weave. Either ask the book seller for a replacement or…
3. Investigate how one might get something back from Sigrid.
You… guess there’s nothing to do now but move forward. One foot in front of the other, picking up the pieces and seeing what comes next. You might be bad at everything you try, but at least you’re turning out to be pretty bad at giving up. 
You think you can still make this better, but you’ve got plenty to do. You have to get a new copy of the letter for Quill-Weave, find some clothes, apologize for the damage to the chapel, see if there’s any way to get something back from Sigrid…
In fact, now that you think about it, you need some way to mentally keep track of all this…

You try casting some fire with the amulet still on. When that doesn’t work, you try casting some fire without the amulet. Neither seems to have any effect at all. Even when you think up the best cat burns you can muster, nothing happens. You aren’t sure what was going on with your powers last night, but right now you can’t seem to get anything from them at all. 
It’s probably for the best, you guess. Now that your head’s clearer, you realize that you got a little too into the whole wizard thing yesterday. You almost forgot you were a homeless, uneducated farm girl with exactly one day of magic experience – and as good as it felt to forget that, it probably just made you act like a giddy idiot. And then get robbed, and almost burn to death. 
After that dream you’re not exactly in the mood for fire right now anyway, so you should probably just lay off the magic until you have a better idea what you’re doing. Just because you read about something in books and vaguely know what it is doesn’t mean you have any idea how to actually use it. 
You let the Cyrodiilic gods know you’re sorry for irresponsibly wrecking their sweet pad in an uncontrollable fire rage last night. There’s no reply. You even try leaving an offering as a gesture of good faith.
At least you’re pretty sure that’s what the thing in the middle is for.

Yeah… after that number you did to the chapel, the least you can do is lend a hand making it better. Weedum-Ja seemed pretty nice when you met her yesterday, so you shuffle over to see how she’s doing.
Hey, you say. She doesn’t answer. 
You ask her if she needs any help cleaning up. No, she says, she’s got this. 
You ask if she’s sure, because it looks like there’s still a lot of little burnt pew pieces lying around. And also some pretty bad scorch marks on the stonework over there, and that carpet probably needs to be –
Weedum-Ja sighs and asks what you want.
You tell her that you might have messed up the chapel a little last night, and you’re really sorry. Yeah, she says, she noticed. You explain that it was kind of a crazy night in general; you went to the Mages Guild and it turned out they were evil and they mind controlled you, robbed you, and threw you out on the street, and then a thunderstorm started so you went into the chapel for shelter, but then your magic powers started going out of control and – 
She cuts you off and says not to waste your breath. She woke up this morning to find half the flammable objects in the chapel incinerated, a naked mage passed out by an altar, and the shattered remains of an empty mead bottle lying nearby. She has a pretty good idea what… transpired.
You try to explain that it wasn’t like that. I mean, you guess you’ve done stuff like that in the past, but this time it really wasn’t… yeah, you get a feeling she doesn’t believe you. 
You try to segue into some smalltalk instead, asking if anyone stopped by to see you last night. Weedum-Ja says some people came to gawk, yes. The guard captain, that dunmer woman, and some others. You ask whether anyone with a particularly golden, luminescent voice stopped by perchance. Weedum-Ja just ignores the question. 
So… yeah. You tell her you’re just trying to get back on your feet now. Trying to find some new clothes, find someone who can give advice on getting your magic under control, maybe find some proper, paying work around town. You really don’t mean to impose, but if she knows anything about magic, or has any extra clothes she isn’t using, you’d –
Weedum-Ja frustratedly exclaims that maybe you should have thought to ask these kind of things before you got drunk off your ass and trashed the goddamn chapel! 
Look. She says she’s sorry, this has just been a really bad start to her day. She and the other chapel workers already left you a blanket to cover up with and let you sleep off whatever drunken stupor you got yourself into. She’s sure you can find someone else who can help you the rest of the way. Someone else to deal with your issues for a while. 
Right now she’d just prefer if you gathered up your things and got out. Before you cause any more problems for her to deal with. 
See if you can get free clothes if you sign up for the dance competition!
Well you need clothes, you’re all out of dignity anyway.
You return to the Kvatch Arena. 

You save time by doing both at once.
The arena master compliments you on the nice injury. 
Thanks, you say. You can’t see shit out of it.

Anyway, the arena. This arena. There was a dance competition or something here, right? 
Yes, he sighs. About every week or so. There’s one happening the day after tomorrow. 
Could someone still sign up for that?
The orc says he cannot fathom why any self-respecting individual would want to, but yes. Someone could. 
And…. you’ve heard some arenas give all the competitors armor and stuff, to make sure they’re outfitted the same way. Is there anything like that here?
Yes, the orc replies, as tribute to his arena’s golden age they still outfit all competitors with their choice of a light or heavy Kvatch Arena ra- I’m sorry, are you wearing a bedsheet?
No, you explain, this is a priceless tapestry professionally emblazoned with the white flag of surrender. You were looking through your vast wardrobe for something to wear today and this just seemed like the most appropriate. Tell me more about the free outfit.
Right. The orc explains that it’s an armored arena raiment. Standard issue, back when this place had real fights and he gave a damn. As back then, the competitor gets a choice between a light or heavy raiment when they sign up.
So I could actually request heavy armor for a dance competition?
Not if you’re trying to convince him you have any intent of actually competing, he says. 
Fair enough.
Though, ah, about that. Hypothetically, if I did sign into this dance competition thing, would there be any sort of obligation to actually go through with it? Anything binding me into it?
No, the orc says, theoretically you could just mislead him, sign up, take his fancy arena armor, and leave forever. There’s really nothing he could do to stop you if you did. 
That’s the first good news I’ve heard all day!
But I won’t do that.
You tell the arena master you respect his profession. Running an arena and all. 
After you change you’ll even leave him this blanket as collateral, if he wants.
He asks you why there are two holes torn in it. You tell him that you didn’t want to be recognized on the way over here so you just kind of ghosted. In retrospect though you guess you only needed one.

You apologize for taking up so much of his time. You just have a couple more questions you want to clear up before committing yourself to anything. 
Assuming you actually do compete, there is a potential cash prize, right? Yes, he says. The exact amount varies; it’s a cut of the admission fees, depending how many bored people come to gawk.
You ask whether magic is allowed. Your relationship with it right now is a little complicated, but you want to know if the option is on the table. He says you can use anything you need; magic, potions, a bonemold shield, whatever.
You ask him if the dance has to be something sleazy. He reminds you that you were the one who got half naked and started clambering all over a lamppost. He had nothing to do with that.
Oh. Right. And, ah, lastly, you ask him what your chances of actually winning this are. Hypothetically, if you entered. He tells you that the very fact you are having this conversation means you have put more thought into this than anyone else who has ever come through those doors, ever. So probably pretty good.
Alright then. You guess…. what do you have to do to sign up?
The arena master says there’s just one question you have to answer: blue team or yellow team?
You ask him what he means.
He tells you that the competition is team-based, and they’re even right now. It just determines what color raiment you get and whether you’re teamed with the nord or the dunmer. Usually he’d just shuffle someone like you onto Yellow with the nord for color consistency, but he figures he might as well give you the choice. Maybe let you turn this into a gent-versus-ladies thing, if you want. 
So, yellow or blue. What will it be, khajiit?

everything
You, ah…
Anything, really. You’re just looking to learn more about her. You explain that you met with her last night. She was very charming. Really knew what she was doing. The guildhall looked like she only moved in recently though. 
Ilden tells you that you’re right on that; she only moved to Kvatch a year or two ago. It ain’t a big secret that the local guildhall used to be a necromancy study ground. Lots of real eerie folks in there doin’ wrong things. He isn’t sure where Sigrid moved from, but once she got to the Kvatch Mages Guild she cleaned the place up into a respectable establishment. Cleaned it up good. 
You point out that it wasn’t actually very clean in there. In fact, the place was kind of a mess. It had animals running around. 
Ilden says it was just a, whaddaya call it, a metaphor. You can’t expect the poor woman to actually clean the place on top of everything else she does. She’s already running the whole place on her own. Well, her and that skeevy priest-boy. 
Anyhow, once she got settled in first thing she did was work her way ’round the different establishments in town. Chatted with folks, told ’em about all the good a Mages Guild could do. Potions, protective spells and the like. The girl had a silver tongue and a heart of gold. By the end of the day I daresay she was something of a local hero. 
Did she have any enemies? You tell Ilden that you have a hard time envisioning any one person, like, actually making all the friends. There’s no one at all who even has a grudge against her? 
He reckons there been a few people who weren’t too pleased with her at first. Mostly mage-folk from out at the university who thought she was up to something shady, from what he’s gathered. They always came around once she had a chance to speak with them, of course. You still got that little wood-chopper from yesterday?
The, ah, hatchet? You explain that half of it was eaten by slaughterfish and half of it was stolen. It really didn’t stand a chance.
But, since this is just training, you figured you could just use this piece of paper you rolled up into a –
Right then. 
What about thieves? Even if she’s the nicest person on Nirn, she still has a lot of valuables stowed away in that guildhall. Wouldn’t there be thieves interested in breaking in to take it? 
Ilden says he understands your concern, but assures you Sigrid is more than capable of taking care of herself. Kvatch has never had much in the way of thievery; this is a mountaintop city with one way in and out. If a heist goes south or the guards catch wind, that thief’s only escape would be through the main gate. Even if you had a career criminal in town he reckons they wouldn’t be willing to take a chance like that. Now c’mon; swing that around some so he can see what sort of technique you’ve got already. 
He snickers at your best efforts and remarks that he’ll at least have no problem finding something to teach you. 

Wow, alright, Ilden says, stop before you hurt yourself. You’re swinging that thing around like a monkey with a switchblade.
You tell him you’re sorry, you’re kind of new to this. 
He says it’s alright. We all had to start somewhere. 
He explains that a club is a heavy weapon. It’s going to be slow to start, hard to steer, and – once it gets up to speed – hard to stop. You can’t just whip it around like a fencing foil; you have to get a feel for the weapon’s weight and guide it, not force it. Let it swing, follow through, and get it back to somewhere it can swing again.
Like, just let it go in circles, you ask?
Sure, he says, if it helps. Get a feel for the weapon and start working with its weight rather than against it.

Vins wrote: I don’t think you’ll get to know much more about Sigrid. What about Stephane? Perhaps there’s something useful about him you should know? 
While you swing around your tree branch you ask Ilden about that “skeevy priest-boy” he mentioned earlier. 
What’s the deal with him, anyway? Like, as far as you can tell he and Sigrid are the only people in town associated with the Mages Guild. Did he move into Kvatch the same time as her? 
Naw, Ilden says, that boy has been around town for ages. Real ornery fellow, mostly spends his time away from other folks. At least folks who ain’t Sigrid. Ilden says that he doesn’t know much about him beyond that.
What about his relationship with Sigrid? Are they friends, or is he just some kind of second-in-command, or what? 
Ilden admits he doesn’t know much about it. As far as he knows the boy’s just another admirer, ‘cept he has a Mages Guild membership of course.
A guild membership… which would mean he has a key to the Kvatch Mages Guild, right?
Probably, Ilden shrugs. Can’t imagine why he wouldn’t.
Do you know where I might be able to find him during the day? Anywhere that I could, like, possibly catch him when he’s alone?
Ilden says that he quite frankly doesn’t keep track of these things. Though he has to say, you’re starting to ask some mighty strange questions about this guy. Is there anywhere you’re goin’ with this?
You tell him you are just incredibly attracted to skeevy priests. Like, the skeevier they are the more irresistible you find them. You assure him this entire line of inquiry is purely sexual in nature.  
So how do I kill people? 
Ilden tells you that’s a question he can answer. You look to be getting a handle on the weapon, but  if you want to do any serious damage you have to put your body into it more than you were. Your arm is just going to guide the club; the force is coming from the ground up. 
He suggests that you loosen up your grip a little and try a swing at him. Those noodle arms aren’t going to do much on their own, so make up for it by shifting your weight forward on the swing – less arm, more torso. 
You nod, and tell him you… think you can do that, yeah.  

Wow, rude.

Welp, Ilden continues, he reckons that’s probably enough for one day. Frankly, he’s surprised that twig lasted as long as it did, being something that fell out of a tree. 
You were hoping to get a bit more practice in, but yeah, you tell him you probably have some other stuff you should be concerning yourself with. 
That felt good, though! Like, learning to do something and being able to let off a little steam in the process. Just knowing that you can kind of do something you couldn’t before, there’s something really… confidence…ing about that. 
He tells you not to let it go to your head. Having a passably decent swing is important, but there’s a lot more to proper combat. Blocking, responding to attacks, moving around, breaking through defenses… not to mention keeping your armor in shape, keeping your weapons sharp and whatnot. 
You nod and tell him you understand. 
After a bit of hesitation you half-chuckle and confess that while you’re no fighter, you actually tried your hand at armor repair once, years ago. 
You read about it in this book and thought, like, maybe it was something you could handle. So you saved up a week’s worth of stolen silverware and got one of those little hammers for pounding dents out of metal. Figured you’d repair some things, get some practice, maybe get really good at it someday. Eventually you even managed to find some knight who wanted his armor fixed up while he went barhopping.
You were all excited about it, and then as soon as you try to pound one of the fasteners back into shape your little hammer snapped in half. You spent like two hours freaking out and trying to fix it before the knight came back, got mad that nothing was done, took his armor and stormed out. So, yeah, armorer wasn’t for you. 
‘Course, it wasn’t a total loss. You did manage to pocket a gauntlet before he left, which found its way to a pawn shop and, soon, was converted into a couple rounds of ale. 
But really… thanks. You know, for treating me like an actual human being. Er, not human, I mean… two-legged… thing. I think I need that every once in a while.
Ilden says it was his pleasure. Just try to take what he taught you and use it to not get eaten by monsters. You tell him you’ll try, but can’t make any promises. 
Anyhow, it’s gettin’ late. Old people late. He oughta head off. Good seeing you, Desert-Cat. 
Likewise, you say. 
Right. 
See you. 
And, ah, “Desert-Cat”, you ask?
Just seemed fitting, he says. Got a tinge of old Alik’r in your voice.
Oh, you say. You hadn’t really heard that before, and aren’t sure what it means, but you guess it sounds cool.

You are not planning to kill anyone. But you’re thinking this through and it is likely you might have to defend yourself. If you are trying to circumvent Sigrid’s evil machinations and get that package back, you risk causing her some big problems. And, not gonna lie, you probably come across as pretty killable already. You can’t imagine that will get much better once you start giving someone an incentive to get rid of you.
You’re committed to this, though. It probably sounds like a bad idea, but Quill-Weave is still counting on you to finish this job and it would be a good idea to show her you can. So, technically, this plan is more like a good idea with some rough edges. Extremely rough edges, that involve being murdered. But you’re sure you can figure out some way around those. 
Even what you’re doing now needn’t go in the quest log; it’s just a side quest or even a stepping-stone for Entry #2. 
Do NOT forget to learn about that dream!
Yeah, the dreams aren’t something you easily forget about. 
It’s probably about 3:16, and you don’t really have any direct leads on Stephane right now. You could check for him at the chapel, but you didn’t see him there this morning and you’d rather catch him when he’s alone, if you can. 
For the time being, you feel like your biggest priority should be finding someone to analyze these dreams, finding some references on alchemy so you can maybe counteract whatever Sigrid has in store, or finding out what’s up with your amulet so you can… not burn to death when you least expect it, you guess. 
You’re not sure what it says about you that these three things are roughly of equal importance in your mind. 

First of all, it was a bookstore, not a library. Those books are in there for people (or bipedal cats) to purchase, and to just sit in there reading them for free seems kind of douchey. 
Second, you don’t have time to sit around and read all day. Your uncontrollable pyrokinetic powers have begun igniting things around you without rhyme or reason, the crippling nightmares that have plagued you since childhood have apparently started to communicate with you, and you are currently in the midst of a poorly-conceived plan to break into an evil wizard’s lair to steal back and subsequently deliver a package in an attempt to prove your competence to the one person in the world who seems to believe in you despite your flaws – not to mention you don’t have any money for food, you don’t yet have anywhere to stay tonight, and you’re pretty sure if you try to sleep outside it will start raining again simply because that is the sort of thing that happens to you.
And third, you can’t just wander into a bookstore and blindly start reading books in hopes of learning something useful from it. There are dozens of different books in there, and reading even half of them would probably take you…
Well, a couple hours at most. You’re a pretty fast reader.
Your point about it being a total douche move still stands, though.
While the Arcane University would probably have an expansive library and maybe even wizards willing to help you against Sigrid, it’s also halfway across the country and, from what you’ve read about it, very selective about who may enter. 
You admit that there is still a small, magic-loving part of you that wants to drop everything you’re doing and hike all the way there just to see what the place is actually like. However, given that your giddy mage-worship got you robbed yesterday, you’d rather not let it take you on an impromptu, unaccompanied, cross-country journey today. It’s probably best if you just stay in Kvatch and its surrounding countryside until Asotil returns to escort you back to Anvil.

Now that is true. You’ve gathered that there aren’t many professional mages in town besides Sigrid and her lackey, but even someone with a mild familiarity with magic might be able to help you get your powers under control or get past Sigrid’s charms. Or even have thoughts on these dreams, now that you think about it. 
You check around for the Crazy Poison Lady who gave you that recharge yesterday, but it looks like she’s moved on. Maybe she found that mysterious person she was waiting for? 
Next up is that cultist by the front gate. You know you’re trying to distance yourself from the whole “cults” thing, but he seemed like an okay guy – and someone who might have some magic background.
Sadly, it doesn’t look like he’s here right now either. The campfire is still there, but there’s nobody around other than-
Oh fuck.
It’s that guy.

Huh? No you’re not. Gaius Atrum is that guy right there. You met him up on the battlements yesterday while you were exploring the town, and he sort of freaked when he heard you used to be a cultist. He’s doing it again now that you’re pointing at him. 
Anyway, as endearing as he was yesterday, you have more important priorities right now.

You greet Gaius as politely as you can. He regains his professional composure, stands a safe distance away from you, and rather sternly asks what you want… you cultist.
You ask him if he’s seen that elf in the red robe around anywhere. You’ve been having some magic problems lately, and you are looking around for any mages who might kn-
That elf in the suspiciously cultist-like attire, he asks? That same elf who has been waiting out front for his no-doubt cultist friends to show up, presumably to do bizarre and probably unruly cultist things? Things an admittedly cultist-like individual such as yourself would quite possibly be involved in? Why would you be looking for him? Are the two of you… up to something?
With an exasperated deadpan you explain that you really are just looking to get some magic help. You assure Gaius that you are no longer involved in any cults. Your cultist years were a long time ago, and they mostly just involved wild yet harmless parties – nothing to get paranoid about. No cults here. You haven’t even-
He cuts you off again and tells you that’s exactly the sort of thing a secret cultist would say. He is on to you and your cultist plans. And there is no chance in hell he is going to willingly help you locate your “cultfriend“, as he hears the kids are calling them these days. 
Right then. You ask him if he at least knows any other non-guild mages in town who you could speak with.
Even if he did, he explains, he certainly wouldn’t direct a terrifying, living, breathing cultist to them. 
This conversation is unbelievably stupid and going nowhere.

Yeah, this mage-search has been kind of a bust. And all this ragging on your cultist past is kind of starting to piss you off. 
You tell Gaius that, as much as you’d love to continue this interrogation, you have important things to do. So you’re just gonna head back into town and… do them. 
Alright, he says. But he’s got his eye on you. He’ll know what sort of strange, cultist things you and your friends are up to. He’ll uncover your cultist conspiracy. 
You tell him one last time that he’s being ridiculous. You aren’t a cultist, or involved in any conspiracy. You’re just gonna go try to earn some money repainting a sign, then maybe talk to that counselor guy about the recurring, monochrome nightmares you’ve been having since you were a child. It’s nothing a guard captain has to be wor-
A…are you mocking me, cultist? Who have you been speaking to? Which one of your cultist spies is feeding you information?
Feeding you information? You tell him that you have no idea what he’s talking about, but he’s kind of starting to scare you now. You’re gonna go into town and find a guard who isn’t-
Don’t play dumb with me, Khajiit! Y-you know what I’m talking about! 
Who told you about my nightmares?
For what already feels like the millionth time, you tell the paranoid guard captain you have no idea what he’s going on about. You’re not involved in any kind of cultist conspiracy and you don’t know anything about-
Wait, what did you say?

Nightmares! You said you had nightmares! Are you talking about, like, recurring, terrifying, monochromatic, and probably unnecessarily silhouetty nightmares? Unnatural feeling nightmares?
The Captain says that he suspects you already know the answer to that question, what with your cultist sp-
No! NO! No cultists right now! This is serious! After fifteen years of sleepless nights and ruined childhoods and drinking away pain and searching for answers you are my first actual lead and you are going to tell me everything you know. EEEEEVERYTHING.
EVERYTHING.

Huh, that probably would have been way better than what you actually did, yeah. 
You cough politely and admit to Gaius that you might have approached that wrong. You calmly explain that you’ve been suffering recurring nightmares since you were a child, and from what he is implying it sounds like they might be very similar to his. You realize that he probably doesn’t trust you and that you’ve possibly made some bad mistakes in your past but right now he is the first person you have ever met who sounds like they might know something – anything – about these dreams. Finding him all of a sudden like this might be the one lucky break you’ve ever had on anything, ever. And you kind of want him to tell you everything he knows. 
He still doesn’t completely believe you. The two of you simply running into one another like this would be too much of a coincidence. It feels like you have some dark, ulterior motive here.
You assure him that you are the sort of person who blindly walks into traps, continually acts without thinking, and repeatedly sabotages her own plans without knowing any better. Ulterior motives are far beyond your level. 
… alright, yeah, he looks you over and eventually admits you do give that vibe, yes. 
Even if your words are truthful, though, Gaius says there is not much he could tell you. Even after decades of searching for answers about his nightmares his efforts have turned up very little. His nights are still haunted with those dark dreams of just… being there, trapped in a small, dark room with a cultist. No way out, no one to help him. And the cultist just stands there, being a cultist. 
Yes. Yes! That is just like yours…. except with cultists? You guess that makes sense, you say, given his apparent fear of cultists. Your dreams are about kings though. 
He’s not afraid of cultists, he says, just appreciates their inherent danger on a deeper level than the average person does. And you dream about… kings? Kings aren’t even scary.
Kings are scary as fuck, you reply. Cultists, on the other hand, aren’t even dangerous. 
Also, what’s that smoke coming from town?
Gaius says that’s probably just Miss Lenka’s weekly barbecue. Nothing to be concerned about.
Ah, okay.
Whatever. Kings and cultists aside, the dreams still sound really similar. And this is really the first time ever you’ve found any sort of clue on what they are, what they mean, or that such things even exist outside your own head. If he knows anything at all about them, it would mean a lot to you if he would share it. 
Gaius says, once again, that even if you have the same affliction as him there’s nothing useful he could tell you. He has spent years searching for answers. He has read countless books on the topic, traveled across Tamriel in search of experts, spoken to numerous counselors, and even put himself under the scrutiny of the Guild’s top mages, all to no avail. In all his searching, only once did he find a possible clue… 
… and that was when he spoke to the Daedric Prince of Nightmares herself.

You are now Captain Gaius Atrum, about one month in the past.

Recap? 
You are a man of ACTION and PROBLEM SOLVING. You approach life HEAD-ON, never flinching or stopping to look back. You don’t have time to stand around idly thinking about past events. 
But, since you’ve arrived a little ahead of schedule, a bit of recapitulation couldn’t hurt. 
You currently stand in the KVATCH MAGES GUILD. A cold wind whistles outside, its ominous hum complementing the dark actions you are about to undertake. For today, after years of searching for answers as to what could be causing your constant, terrifying dreams of CULTIST TERRORS you have perhaps found the means to an answer. For today, you seek an audience with VAERMINA, the DAEDRIC PRINCE OF NIGHTMARES. 
The only way for an ordinary, non-cultist mortal to speak face-to-face with a Daedric Prince is through the summoners of the CABAL, an elite group of mages who do not come cheap nor serve just anyone. But the mysterious and alluring alchemist SIGRID has agreed to help you on your plight, scheduling for the unholy Prince of Nightmares to be summoned, here in Kvatch, at the stroke of midnight. 
And now, you have arrived in the guild to seek your answers. Midnight rapidly approaches, you have many questions to ask, and you do not intend to squander one moment of this opportunity. 
See, this is the sort of pointless nonsense that does absolutely nothing but waste time, unbefitting of a brave man of action such as yourself. 
Sure, maybe your compatriots in the guard think your continual suspicions of CULTIST PLOTS are irrational, and maybe they don’t believe your incredibly reasonable assertions that INVISIBLE CULTISTS could be standing around us right now, but that doesn’t mean you should start strapping weapons to a bunch of dogs so they can watch your back while you sleep. 
That would be ridiculous.
Anyway, you only have one golden retriever, SWORDDOG, and she is already armed to the hocks. 
Good girl. Stay alert. 
Now that’s the sort of headstrong ACTION action you can get behind.
You and Sworddog boldly stroll into the Mages Guild to meet Sigrid for the-
Bah, that’s the third time this week you’ve tripped over the TRAPDOOR TO THE TUNNELS. Sigrid really ought to press it down better. You make a mental note to mention this to her. 
You also make a physical note and put it on the trapdoor to prevent any further harm. The world is dangerous enough with all those SECRET CULTISTS in it, the last thing it needs is occupational safety hazards.
You continue down the hallway and up the stairs. Sigrid should be waiting for you in the-
Oh, great.
It’s that guy. 
“Evening, Captain Atrum. Sworddog. I was beginning to think you wouldn’t show.” 
“I said I’d be here, and a Guard Captain does not abandon his obligations without reason,” you say. “Now, where’s Sigrid? We have a demon lord to consult.”
“She’s in the dining room, aiding in the preparations. I’m surprised you aren’t more excited, Captain Atrum. It’s not every day a Daedric Lord is summoned in Kvatch.”
“‘Excited’ is not a word I distribute lightly, breton. And that smile? Creepy. Stop smiling, that’s an order.”
“This is a Mages Guild, Captain. I will take my orders from Sigrid, as will you. Now, you have questions prepared for the Daedric Lord, I assume? Sigrid will gladly ask them for you if you wish, as I doubt Vaermina will want her time on Mundus wasted while you… tremble in fear.”

Unclevertitle wrote: tell that skeevy wizard guy that trembling in fear is not in your vocabulary. tegerioreo wrote: Anyway, Gaius: Explain the difference between trembling with fear, and trembling with reasonable apprehension.
“I’ve been in the guard longer than you’ve been alive, breton. I’ve seen frenzied trolls burst forth from the ground, men get ripped to shreds by land-roving dreugh, zombies tear down entire villages with nothing but their teeth, and that’s all in the last two years. I can hit an imp with a bow at three hundred yards, kill a grizzly bear in hand-to-hand combat, and cut a man in half with one swing of a sword. ‘Trembling with fear’ isn’t in my vocabulary. I handle the fear, so you prissy magefolk never have to see it.”
“Ah yes,” he says, “forgive me for ever doubting you, Captain Atrum. I was under the mistaken impression that a certain fear was why you sought this meeting out to begin with.”
“There’s a difference between trembling with fear and trembling with reasonable apprehension,” you explain. “Perfectly brave Men Of Action can still tremble with reasonable apprehension, or have recurring, nightly, reasonable-apprehension-inducing nightmares.”
“Also, take off that hood. I find it… unsuitable.”
“I like my hood, Captain Atrum. Now come, Sigrid is waiting. We have a summoning to attend, and I don’t wish to miss this opportunity any more than you do.”
You give a nod of vague disapproval and gesture for him to lead on.
“For a priest of the Nine, breton, you seem awfully excited about this demon summoning.”
“The proper term is ‘Daedric Prince’. And please, sheathe your accusations, Captain. I have no interest in the Prince herself. I merely wish to witness her reaction to Sigrid.”
“It will be like a Daedra reacts to any mortal, I assume. Have you reason to expect anything different?”
The priest looks over his shoulder to say something, but hesitates. “It’s complicated. There are many kinds of mortals, Captain.”
“Indeed. Some are… cultists,” you point out grimly.
The priest does not reply. Suspicious.
At least Sigrid can still be trusted. She’s waiting for you when you enter the dining room.
“Gaius!” she exclaims, “it’s been far too long. Here for a chat, or to watch us tear the fabric of the universe asunder?”
“Pleasure as always, Sigrid. Though we both know quite well why I’m here.”
Sigrid sighs. “Yes yes, forgive a young woman her flirtatious pleasantries. You’re here on business. This room is satisfactory, I hope?”
“It’s small. Will that be dangerous?”
“This is a Daedric Prince, so the size shouldn’t matter. I assure you that I’ve taken every reasonable safety precaution: I locked the windows, I pushed the table and chairs out of the way, I even picked up all the flowers on the ground.”
“Did you really pick up the flowers?” you ask.
“Of course not, Gaius, I’m a mage. I set them on fire. Now, my friend over here is more than ready to call forth Vaermina, provided… you brought your half of the payment, of course.”
“Highway robbery, both of you.”
“Yes, but you can’t help but love us for it.”
Sigrid slips out of the room to grab some ice cream while the Cabal mage begins his incantations. Even untrained in magic as you are, you can feel his DARK SORCERIES begin to waft through the room. The air tastes grayer, the colors look bitter, and even Sworddog seems unnerved by the unholy ambiance.
Sigrid still looks unfazed, of course, but she’s Sigrid.
That’s just what she does.

The dark PRINCE OF NIGHTMARES looms menacingly before you. Sworddog flees the premises, but you, being a brave Captain, stand fast and approach. Glaring into the demon’s soulless eyes, you draw your pre-written and ordered list of questions. Though you could care less about wasting her precious time, a MAN OF ACTION such as yourself doesn’t dally with important matters.

You take a step toward the monster and glare at her. “I didn’t call you here to serve your will, demon. I am a man of virtue and justice who has paid good money to summon you for answers. Answers you will provide me.”
“Then you’ve insolently wasted both our time,” she growls. “It is my day of summoning and I have deeds I need done, and countless loyal servants who would die for the chance to bask in my glory and spread my horrors across Mundus. To be called upon by a trifling man of virtue who offers me nothing is an act worthy of-”
“Miss Vaermina,” Sigrid interrupts, “I apologize for my good friend’s behavior, and I understand you are surely eager to return to Quagmire and disseminate your mighty terror across the planes. However, I have something that I think… might be of interest to you.”
“…Vaermina will be here for some time. You may ask her anything.”

How unique is your condition
Why cultists EveryZig wrote: Don’t ask why you are having these nightmares; a god of nightmares might take that the wrong way.
Instead, ask why you keep having the same nightmare.
With the monster adequately pacified, you retrieve your list and begin your questioning proper. 
You start with the basics, reading your notes word-for-word. “Demon. For nearly fifteen years now, my every sleeping night has been haunted by horrible nightmares-”
“You’re welcome.”
“-And yet, every night it is the same vision. I am alone in a room with a vile, dangerous… cultist.”
“Cultist? Cultists aren’t even…” she trails off and, after a brief hesitation, continues: “Does the dream leave you terrified?”
“It fills me with reasonable apprehension.”
“Is that like fear?”
“It is functionally identical to fear.”
“Then you are right to be scared, mortal, for Vaermina knows your every fear and has shown you a mere fraction of her horrible power! It is through my dark bidding that, every night, you are subjected to these horrors, and it is through my mercy that you awaken every morning in a cold sweat.”
“So you’ve been tormenting me for years with these nightmares?”
“Torment is my sphere, and nightmares my realm. There is certainly no other entity who could be behind it.”
“And why, demon, is it the same dream every night? What meaning is there?”
“A mere mortal could not possibly understand the motives of a god. When Vaermina feeds you these visions – when she casts your mind into that… room full of cultists – it is a gift from her all-knowing will. You have no right to question it.”
“It’s just one cultist.”
“What?”
“The room is just filled with one cultist.”
“How can a room be filled with one cultist?”
“Sometimes he’s really big.”
“That is correct!”
“Vaermina was testing you. About her nightmare, she gave you.”
“May Vaermina speak with this mortal alone?”

“Yes, go, shoo! Vaermina has important business to conduct.” 
“Now. Mortal,” she begins, “Vaermina was being subtle so you would not have noticed this, but her earlier statements about your ‘nightmares’ were what is known among beings of great power as an ‘un-truth’.”
“Actually, I gathered-”
“In reality, I knew nothing of these nightmares – an occurrence most unusual for an omnipotent being like myself. To put it in the crude terms of a lesser creature:”
“Someone is screwing with us. They are giving you boring, stupid nightmares instead of my perfect, terrifying ones.”
Your blood heats to a slight simmer at the insinuation that your nightmares aren’t terrifying (or at the very least, reasonably apprehensionifying), but you hold your tongue on the matter. “If you’re not the one behind these nightmares, demon, then surely you know who is?”
“Few entities are capable of infringing upon my sphere like this, and even fewer would have the gall to try. But Vaermina has her suspicions.”
“Are you a vampire?”
“No.”
“Are we in the province of Morrowind?”
“No.”
“… Vaermina has exhausted her suspicions.”
“… Has it ever spoken to you?”
“The cultist?”
“The dream. A mask can hide a face, but a voice betrays the actor.”
“Never, I’m afraid. Neither the nightmare nor the monster have ever made any attempt to communicate.”
“A shame. Though in his silence, our dream-thief has left an unwitting clue: the curious calling card of one who values their anonymity.”

Squiggles – nightmare mural

You note a tinge of disdain in the word “dream-thief”. Though cosmic happenings may be a mystery to you, a FEARLESS GUARD such as yourself has been serving long enough to know how thieves work.
“If this ‘thief’ you claim is infringing on your domain leaves no name, he’s not doing it as a show of power. He must be doing this for personal revenge against me.”
“While vengeance against a mortal – especially one such as yourself – is certainly understandable and commendable, it does not explain the secrecy. Why enact revenge for so long if not to make the victim cry your name in blissful agony? Why hide your actions from the Lady of Infinite Tortures herself?”
“I mean, he could have just bought a custom nightmare from me if he needed one so direly. They only cost four souls. No need to get sneaky about it.”
“Unless…”
“What if there was a prize afoot? Something so powerful, it could drive one omnipotent being to trespass upon the sphere of another? Something so coveted that it would be kept secret, even from his mortal servant? So indivisible that its seeker would prefer me as an enemy than an accomplice?”
You cock an eyebrow, keeping up with the demon’s meandering line of thought as best you can. “You’re suggesting my nightmares are part of some entity’s gambit to claim a mysterious… prize?”
“Perhaps. Or perhaps it’s nothing but the meaningless proddings of a lesser Prince, or another of the Madgod’s vapid games. Or perhaps the prize exists, but your pointless dreams only exist to distract me from the dream-thief‘s true machinations. A red slaughterfish, if you will.”
“You mean a red herring?”
“There is no such thing as a red herring you daft fool.”

“Wait – you know something! You’ve figured something out.”
“Vaermina has a theory. An incomplete theory, but one nonetheless deserving of her full attention. Even as conjecture, she has allies who need to know… and enemies who may already. She must leave at once.” 
“Our discourse has proved enlightening, bearded human. Should you discover anything further about your dreams or their propagator… this is my home number. Simply employ another capable summoner and contact me post-haste.”
“Hold on, demon. I called you here to provide answers, and you owe me answers – you can’t just leave as soon as you find something! And what about your unsettling painting you were enjoying so much? You didn’t even finish it!” 
“The God of Nightmares owes you nothing, mortal. You have expended your usefulness for the time being, and Vaermina has nothing further to gain from you. You’ve brought an important issue to her attention, and now her efforts must be directed elsewhere.”
“But you’ve only left me with even more questions!”
“You are a mortal standing in the presence of a god, fortunate to have received anything at all. As for Vaermina’s wondrous-yet-incomplete nightmare mural-”
“There. Now it is an aesthetic nightmare. You’re welcome, and goodbye.”
The Daedric Prince of nightmares begins to stalk back into the void. You realize this could be your last chance. 
“Lady Vaermina – please. In nearly fifteen years of searching, you’re the closest I’ve ever come to finding the cause of my torment. If the culprit behind my dreams nearly eluded a Daedric Prince in her own domain, how am I supposed to find answers? What am I supposed to do?”
You half-expect her to continue walking and ignore you, but she turns and gives the slightest smile.
“Simple: ask your dream-thief. Every actor takes their bow sooner or later. Though your unseen malefactor’s actions may give the impression of confidence… Vaermina suspects he is terrified his plan will go astray.”
“W-wait, what do you mean? What does he want me to do? L-”
“-ady Vaermina…”

I’m pretty sure that dream-thief thing talked to me last night! 
What, Gaius says.
You tell him that you were having a really bad nightmare like usual, and then all of a sudden these big, glowing letters appeared.
Big, glowing letters, he says.
Yeah! All lit up like one of those magicka-powered signs outside of a strip club. It was really weird; they basically just told me to stop being afraid.
Big, glowing letters appeared and told you to just stop being afraid, he says.
You nod. What do you think it could mean? Do… you think this somehow could be the cure to both our nightmares? Do you think…
In retrospect, you guess you could have worded that in a way that didn’t sound like complete bullshit.

For now, it’s probably best to let him be. Chasing after someone who wants to get away from you is never a good idea. If you leave him alone a bit, though, maybe he’ll realize you weren’t just mocking him this time. He’s still your one lead on your nightmares, and you don’t want to make him hate you.

Alas, your delicious sandwich has been slain. Gaius’ blow sent it sprawling from your hand and onto the dusty grass where its saucy, porcine contents splattered forth from its freshly-baked body. It didn’t stand a chance. The sandwich has been rendered completely inedible.
Yeah, just kidding. You’re poor. 
You probably could have just gone back to Lenka’s barbecue and asked for another one, but it was already free. Poor or not, you wouldn’t feel right taking advantage of that more than anyone else.
Anyway, it’s only a little dirty. Sort of.

Why would he torment you for 16 years and then act all chummy now?  It just doesn’t make sense, no wonder Gaius thought you were making fun of him.  I know your story is sad, Katia, but someone who had no qualms torturing a child and ruining her life for over a decade isn’t just going to gain a conscience over a couple of nights of a rock bottom Khajiit trying her best not to be scared.
Something’s up, either there are two mysterious players involved or something has the dream thief, scared.  Scared enough to try changing tactics. OldSchoolRPGDude wrote: However, if this voice IS our mysterious dream-thief person, that begs the question:

To be honest, you find all the implications of Gaius’ story kind of… discouraging. You’re trying not to think too hard about it or let it bring you down, but the fact that there is someone behind your nightmares means this is more than some simple affliction that will go away with the right potion. It means something out there, probably something more powerful than the Daedric Prince of nightmares, wants you to suffer. And, fuck, you can’t even do anything about it when people want you to suffer. 
Maybe there is a second player involved. Some god or daedra you tried praying to years ago finally worked their way down to the bottom of their priority list and saw you needed help. 
Even then, it means things are completely out of your control; a quarrel between beings greater than you. And all you can do is sit, wait, and hope for the best. 
And that’s never worked.
Maybe you should’ve chased Gaius.
So… fell on hard times, got kicked down into the dirt, picked itself back up, and now has less pickles in it than before. 
Oh snap! In your face, Self-Loathing. 
You guess it has been a while since you checked it. 
Hey! You can kind of see a little! Kind of! 
Either that story took way longer than you thought or Lenka knows alchemy and was trying some kind of experiment with those sandwiches.
You’re leaning toward the latter because you can apparently kind of see through walls right now.

As nice as that would be, you are fairly sure seeing through walls does not entail the ability to walk through locked doors, see into people’s thoughts, or… see money out of people. However that works. Scouting the imps in Tavia’s attic could be kind of useful – if it’s just one, you could maybe eye-of-fear it – but that’s pretty far away and it looks like your, ah, “EAGLE VISION” is already wearing off.
Aaaaaand it’s gone.
You guess that’s probably a good idea, yeah. I mean, it’s getting late. You still need a place to stay tonight, and if Lenka knows alchemy maybe she could tell you which local plants around Kvatch are valuable. Or make you another weird eye-healing, wall-permeating sandwich so you can count those imps proper. 
You head back to the field where you and Gaius stopped by the barbecue during his long flashback, but the grill is already packed up and Lenka is nowhere to be found. 
You do manage to find a scrap of bread, though. 
You put it in your inventory, since you’re apparently the sort of person who scavenges scraps of bread off the ground now. 
Whoop-de-doo.
You know you said this before, but… you really don’t want to talk about this. Or think about it. 
It doesn’t feel like you’re “important”. If anything, it’s just a reminder that nearly everything is out of your control. You used to at least be able to blame yourself; to keep telling yourself that this was all your fault, and if you lived life differently and changed who you were, things could change. If you couldn’t be happy, Katia Managan could. You used to be able to believe that the old life you drove into the ground was just a prequel to something good. 
But now… you know that something is out to get you. Something big, that you can’t shed with a change of name, or run from in another country. You don’t know why, you don’t know what it wants, but you just know it’s one more in a world of things and people working against you, and you’re powerless to stop a single one of them. 
The world wants you to fail, and there’s nothing you can do to control it. 
And that feels…
Well, you don’t want to think about what it feels like. You guess you’re just going to keep going. You’ll eat food off the ground, try to find some way to make money, and hope that whoever’s out to get you that day of the week takes pity. 
You guess the word for it is “scared”. Not a sharp, sudden fear, but a low, dull, hopeless hum. If you smile, joke, and ignore it, maybe you won’t have to feel it. 
Of course, that’s kind of ruined now.

It would only be appropriate to redistribute some of that ill-gotten loot to the poor folks Sigrin has downtrodden and oppressed. Like you, for instance.
You have been thinking about this, on the other hand, and…
Well, you’re with Sabata2 here: you think it might be time to throw in the towel on getting your stuff back from the Kvatch Mages guild. 
You know it would fix things. You really do. Getting Quill-Weave’s package back would prove to her you can be trusted, and even a handful of coins from that goddamn heap would solve your food and housing problem for weeks to come. 
However, it’s also a huge, dangerous gamble. And unlike delving into an ancient ruin in hopes of finding treasure or jumping down a well to kill some fish, you don’t even have a place to start. It’s just false hope; the warm feeling that if you could get in there, it would certainly be nice. Idealistic false hope like that is the sort of thing that lured you in there to begin with.
Not to mention… well, you’re safe now. They took your stuff, they probably think you’re still under the spell of Sigrid’s weird pheromone stuff or whatever, and they have no reason to come after you further. If you start trying to cause them problems, who knows what will happen. Whatever it is, you suspect it won’t end pretty for you. You want everything to be better, but you guess you’re starting to realize that you can’t be careless about it. 
There’s still that low, quiet feeling of anger telling you that you should do something, that you should get some kind of revenge. But you just have to keep reminding yourself that this isn’t a storybook, and you’re not some sort of hero. And even if you wanted to be, the entire situation is still out of your control. 
You notice your thoughts heading back down that path and push them away. You’re wasting the meager remaining daylight, and you still have plenty to do if you don’t want to sleep hungry on the streets. 
So yeah. You are making an executive decision right now, in spite of all argument: no more fantasies about taking down the Kvatch Mages Guild. Quill-Weave is still counting on you not to screw up. Between this and your nightmares, you have to focus on what is in your reach, not waste time chasing after unseen malefactors.

Okay, Stephane notes, he has gathered that you are certainly very mad about something. It’s probably something insignificant that Sigrid can work out pretty easily, right? Sigrid is pretty great, we should talk to her. About this.
You remind him that you tried talking to Sigrid. All that came out of it was getting mind controlled, robbed, and thrown out naked on the street. 
Alright, wow, you actually… yes, he was slightly worried that was what this was regarding. 
You don’t take kindly to being someone’s pawn, you say. Katia Managan doesn’t take kindly to that bullshit. You want to know what’s going on with the Kvatch Mages Guild, how to get your stuff back from Sigrid, and who the hell he is and what role he’s playing in this evil mindfuckery. And you want to know it now.
Stephane assures you he’s just an ordinary priest from the temple of Akatosh. You could go to the temple of Akatosh, right over there, and ask them. 
Bullshit, you say. An “ordinary priest” doesn’t lure people into some weird necromancer den and rob them blind.
He points out that he didn’t actually r-
You cut him off and say that you’re onto him. You bet he just brainwashed everyone into thinking he’s a priest, what with his weird wizardly mindwarpery stuff, and he’s really some kind of creepy, evil, necromancer, vampire… sload. Thing. 
You bet that’s what the creepy hood is for. You bet it somehow hides his evilness. You bet if you take it off, he’ll melt in the sun or something from being such an evil jerk. 
Huh. Nice locks.
If you’re quite done playing around, Stephane says, then you ought to let him get up so the two of you can properly discuss your newfound… theories. If you were able to throw off Sigrid’s charms, then he supposes there’s no sense trying to hide anything from you. That is, if you would kindly get off of him so the two of you can discuss this like rational adults.

So just to get this straight: you’re going to answer my questions, openly and truthfully? Everything about you, Sigrid, Kvatch, and how to get back my stuff?
Stephane rolls his eyes. As he said, if you’ve somehow already found a way around Sigrid’s magic, then there is no reason to hide anything from you. Better you be fully informed than half-informed. 
And you’re not going to try to kill me or mind-control me into jumping off a cliff or something to keep me from telling everyone your evil plans?
He tells you that he’s a priest, not a murderer. If he harbored the slightest desire to kill you, the two of you could have easily avoided a laborious and tiring chase.

Again, he repeats, he’s willing to answer your questions if you’ll just get off him.
And maybe you could throw in a non-alcoholic drink, too, since I’ve been chasing you all over town? I mean it’s just that I can’t really get water from a well or anything and I think the guy who was giving out the free lemonade is gone now, so it’d be kind of nice. You know. To have something to drink.
Stephane tells you that you’re milking this a bit. You remind him that you’re the one making demands here, and you’ve still got a rock you can throw at his face in a technically-legal way. Okay, he concedes, he’ll throw in a drink.
Alright then.
Well, he asks?
You admit that you might need a little help getting up. You haven’t actually been able to feel your legs since you jumped off that last rooftop.
Stephane drags you to a more comfortable spot for you to properly interrogate him. 

Stephane negotiated your reentry. 
And by that you mean he dragged you inside, flipped the Khajiit bartender off, and ordered you some milk. 
The bartender didn’t seem happy about it, but you’ll probably be fine as long as you don’t do anything stupid this time.
All you manage to create is some sort of horrible milk taco.
1: The package 
2: Your money 
3: Evil mage conspiracy involving Sigrid and the Guild (but remember as long as you get what you need, this isn’t necessarily your problem)
4. Getting the rest of your stuff back including your robes is probably worth a try, considering how quickly you go through clothes. No offense.
Right. You cut to the chase. 
You tell Stephane that when he robbed you, he took a very important package you have to deliver. You need to know if there’s a way to get it back from Sigrid’s evil clutches, and if so, how. 
Stephane raises an eyebrow and points out that all Sigrid took from you was a handful of coins, a cheap “robe”, and less than ten septims worth of old books and supplies. He can’t envision anything there being important enough to warrant chasing him across the entire city.
You tell him that it’s… complicated. But more importantly, those things weren’t his to take. It wasn’t right, and you need to fix that. 
Look, you say, if you’re not going to actually help me, then at least tell me what sort of bullshit Sigrid has going on so I can help myself. I’m not out for blood or anything; I just want to get my stuff and get out of here so I can start setting things right. 
And it just so happens that, to do that, I need to know how to break into the lair of an evil psycho-bitch with mind control powers. 
She’s not ev-
Did I mention the part where she mind-controlled me, robbed me, and threw me out on the street naked?
Look, just… keep your voice down. I confess Sigrid may have overstepped some implicit boundaries, but technically you were not “mind controlled”, nor were you “robbed”. And she’s not “evil”, she’s just… an opportunist. If you’d let me explain, I can show you she’s not the badguy here.
Alright, so…
This all started about a year or so ago. Up until then, Sigrid lived as an ordinary alchemist. She was a Mages Guild member – a low ranking one, and she still is – and spent most of her time minding a little potion shop over in Skingrad. As far as anyone was aware, there was nothing particularly outstanding or unusual about her. 
This was right after the Mages Guild stopped supporting the practice of necromancy, when Hannibal Traven took over as Archmage. Sigrid wasn’t active with guild affairs at that point, but caught wind that the Guild’s old Necromancy hub, the Kvatch Mages Guild, had been all but abandoned after the ban. Without any guild tenants, the Archmage was planning to have Kvatch’s guildhall demolished. 
It was in that very same minute, by pure happenstance, that Sigrid met a Hlaalu alchemist who had lost everything in an unexpected house fire. Her shop, her money, everything she had worked to build in Cyrodiil, and all her potions…
… other than eighty six gallons of questionably legal Telvanni Bug Musk.
Telvanni what now?
Bug Musk, Stephane whispers. It’s a… perfume, made in the far east. It might be a type of magic potion, or some kind of repurposed insect pheromone; he’s not sure. Like most things Telvanni, the details are vague at best.
What matters, however, are its interpersonal effects. One spray of the substance is said to make a beggar as compelling as a learned politician, an illiterate barbarian as persuasive as an expert merchant… or an ordinary man as revered as a king. 
Excuse me, are you well?
Yeah, you say. I just expected more warning there. So you’re saying she just bought some magic perfume off this other alchemist, and now she can just spray herself with some whenever she wants anything?
Not exactly, Stephane says. Telvanni Bug Musk is powerful, but it’s not powerful enough for the wearer to completely control those around her – at least not on its own or in small amounts. 
But, yes, Sigrid bought the entire pallet of potions without hesitation, trading the alchemist everything she owned – her shop, her inventory, her savings… everything except the clothes on her back, and enough septims for one night at a quality inn. As soon as she made the trade, she took her potions, left Skingrad, and headed for the city of Kvatch. 
Why Kvatch, you ask? Why not just stay where she was, or find an even bigger city to do her… stuff… to?? 
Because Kvatch needed her, he says. They were about to lose their only guildhall for mages. And after housing a necromancer laboratory for so long, they had a very grim image of magic. They needed someone to convince them of the importance, righteousness, of the magical arts. And as I said… 
Sigrid was an opportunist. 

 

By the end of her first day in Kvatch, she had become a local celebrity: a newcomer who had won the heart of every citizen.
Within a week, she was wealthier than the counts. 
She didn’t stop or grow complacent with her position. She poured her time and resources into research. Within the month, she had accrued an encyclopedic knowledge of Tamriel’s greatest speakers, merchants, and conmen. Her tongue was silver even without mind-altering alchemy.
Not that it mattered for her. Within the year, she had cashed in on many of her old Guild connections and commissioned enough enchantments to render the bug musk all but unnecessary.
Anyway, between her education and the magical enchantments, her status and power in Kvatch is firmly secured and she is free to pursue whatever grander goals she deems appropriate. That is what Sigrid has been doing in Kvatch.
Lupinator wrote: >Katia: Assess moral compass here.
How justified is Sigrid in all this? TheTurnipKing wrote: Obviously we’re still missing something, because I’m not seeing how opportunistically stealing a guild hall of necromancers isn’t evil.
That doesn’t justify anything.
I wasn’t—
Yeah, you were! You’re acting like just because she’s conniving, powerful, and probably unstoppable, that makes her right! And you’re probably going to pull some bullshit about how good and evil are subjective, so she’s not really that bad.
Stephane says he’s a priest, moral subjectivity isn-
—all so… what? So she can nest in a mound of stolen gold, beloved by everyone, while I’m out in the rain with scraps of bread and maybe half a friend?
Look, Stephane says, he’s not trying to say Sigrid is right about everything she does. Or that her actions don’t come with costs to people who probably don’t deserve it. He’s just trying to explain why he’s helping her.
Why, you ask, because you and everyone else in this town are mind controlled into doing it? Because she’s a heartless, sociopathic megalomaniac who will just charm you into submission if you or anyone else tries to stand up to her? Because she thinks she’s doing some huge favor to the magic community by keeping the Kvatch guildhall there?
No, Stephane says, it’s not that. Well, not exactly. It’s…
I think she might be a hero.

Stephane explains that he doesn’t mean “hero” in the common sense, but the mythical one. Like the great warriors and tricksters of old tales: individuals said to be born outside of fate itself, unaccounted for even in the plans of all-knowing gods and Daedra. Mortals who, solely through their unpredictable nature, could rival omnipotent beings.  
The mythical heroes weren’t good or evil, but instruments of change – powerful wildcards who existed to rival the dominance of those who would otherwise take the world for themselves. 
And the gods, if you believe the old stories, never seemed to care. They’re just like, “hey, at least half the people you killed probably deserved it. Take these Aedric artifacts and just keep on carriagein’.” That makes it alright.
So you’re unquestioningly helping Sigrid on the off chance that she’s destined to become some mythical hero like in old stories that probably aren’t even real?
Stephane notes that “destined” is probably not the appropriate word for it, but… yes, more or less. Sigrid… the way luck shines upon her constantly, the ease with which she achieves her every desire, the fearless manner in which she could confront even a Daedric Prince… he could not be more certain that she is something different – a Hero in the most legendary of senses. Untamed, unstoppable… and needing someone at her side to guide her in the right direction.
… you mean you.
Exactly, he says. As soon as he began to suspect her true nature, he tried his best to maintain her trust and friendship. To dissuade her from wrongdoing, to praise her good works, and to lead her down a path the Nine would approve of. 
As you have no doubt experienced, my success… varies. Sometimes her actions are benevolent – she once conned a highwayman out of a giant, priceless diamond only to wordlessly donate it to the orphanage that night. Other times, such as your pathetic encounter with her, I fear she falls into hubris knowing that no impulsive action she commits will carry consequences. 
I have no wish to jeopardize my relationship with Sigrid by second-guessing her decisions, nor do I wish to in any way inhibit her power. At the same time, that doesn’t mean I agree with all actions she takes. I hold out hope that in time, she will come to have marginally less traits worth despising.

Okay. I think you’re crazy and putting a lot of stock in fairy tales, but I can accept that. I just want to get my stuff back. Can you help with that?
Stephane reiterates that he has no desire to damage his friendship with Sigrid or question her actions. She saw fit to take your belongings for whatever reason, and they are hers now.
However…
It would perhaps be to Sigrid – and the world’s – ultimate benefit if someone more… expendable than himself, who was likewise unaffected by her charisma, took it upon themselves to call her supremacy into question. To give consequence to her careless actions by taking back what was theirs and then some. 
Regardless of whether the thief succeeded or failed, maybe it would be the push needed to spur Sigrid into action. The push needed to make her act like a true hero, actively taking the fight to those who deserved it. 
It would be far too risky to try himself. But if he were to, say, offhandedly mention a secret entrance to the Mages Guild via the chapel undercroft – and you were to, say, slip the chapel key from his pocket when he wasn’t looking…

You eye Stephane uneasily. What’s the catch, you ask? I mean, you’re giving me a key to a building full of riches and asking me to, like, have at it. Forgive me if I expect an ulterior motive.
There is no catch, Stephane says. Sigrid is a hero in need of a push; she needs to be shown there are actual threats out there that can take away the things and power she has accrued. She needs to be shown that these threats not only exist, but can affect her. Anyway, you were the one who first proposed breaking into the Mages Guild, not I. And was it also not you who said someone should stand up to her?
I meant someone should stand up to her by refusing to lick her boots, not by robbing her. And if you want this to happen so badly, why not do it yourself? I mean, you know the building better than I do. You could retrieve my stuff, take all her money, and we’d both be happy.
Because my role is elsewhere. Imagine if I were caught stealing and lost her trust, or if the surprise of her finding me was such that I ended up with a Clannfear latched to my neck. A hero like Sigrid who could flourish and benefit the world under my guidance would be nothing but an uncontrollable monster without it. 
You, on the other hand, are an expendable tool perfect for this act. Whether you leave your mark and escape unseen, escape once she has sighted you, or never escape at all, the job is done and all of Mundus will benefit.

I’m not “expendable”. 
Yes you are, Stephane says. There’s even a picture of you next to the dictionary entry.
That was a generic Khajiit! And he was just an example! 
Look, I know you don’t want to risk doing this yourself, but I’m not an expendable tool. I may not be some kind of hero or whatever, but I’m a person, and if I’m really going to go along with this plan I want you to give me something up front for it.
And if I don’t, Stephane asks?
Then I won’t do it. 
And then what? 
What do you mean, you ask?
Let’s say you turn down your chance to get back at Sigrid, retrieve your oh-so-important books, and make off with a bag full of septims. What will you do then? Another night sleeping on the chapel floor with a bottle of mead? You told Sigrid and I quite a bit about yourself last night. Will you return to your friend in Anvil after another pointless failure? Head off somewhere new? Maybe go back to what you implied was your former career?
…It’s better than being dead.
Really, Stephane says flatly. He’s sure that’s what you were thinking when you climbed down a well of carnivorous fish to get a couple scales, or ran through a collapsing ruin for a couple of old bottles. I think we both know how much your life is really worth. If you were less selfish, perhaps you’d put it on the line for a good cause.

Introspection isn’t really your style!
You’re a guardian spirit. While some ghosts would no doubt be content to rattle spectral chains and wallow in text-walls of self-pity and regret, you get bored pretty quickly when dealing with anything that doesn’t involve large, magical explosions. They’re kind of your thing! 
Also, you’re a Dark Elf. You can’t remember your mistakes because – like all Dark Elves – you have no mistakes! Everything you do is amazing and therefore your valuable time is better spent telling other people about all their problems. 
Like how objectively terrible these commands are.

Last you recall, you were somewhere in southwestern Cyrodiil. 
The dumb descendant you were guarding got himself smoked while scavenging Ayleid lightbulbs from an old ruin. You loitered around his body for a while, until a way better explorer came and blew the ruin up! Then at some point after that you got bored and left. You don’t know. You’ve already forgotten most of the details. The slow, centuries-long descent into all-consuming posthumous ghost-insanity is serious business. 
Anyway, with your entire bloodline shamefully ended by their own stupidity and reproductive selectivity and no descendants left to guard, you’ve just sort of been floating around, talking to the occasional Imperial Legionnaire, and wasting time. Cyrodiil is terrible! Nothing exciting happens here. If you were back in Morrowind, you would’ve already seen like six guys get melted by wild animals!

You are most certainly not “guarding” this dead rabbit! In fact, you have absolutely no idea why this random rabbit is dead to begin with. From the look of things, it is almost as though someone got bored and tried to nail it with a telekinetically thrown rock. And did an amazing job! 
That couldn’t be the case, though, since you are the only sentient entity nearby and you would have remembered doing that – unless your slowly-encroaching ghost-insanity already wiped it from your mind. And since it presumably wasn’t your doing, the rock must have simply fallen from a higher ledge and landed on top of the rabbit by pure chance.
A higher ledge somewhere.
Aha! Mystery solved.

This treasure chest is old, unlocked, and only partially concealed. All common logic dictates that it should have been looted years ago!
Common logic has gradually started to make less and less sense to you, though, and you’re getting pretty heavy magicka readings from it, so you pop the chest open anyway.
Against all logic, the chest contains some ornate women’s clothing.
… and a pretty strong personality-enhancing potion.

For one, you are a Dark Elf ancestral guardian. Your concern with the lesser races should be kept brief and passing at best!
For two… you don’t actually have any idea where she went. While it might be refreshing to compare your descendants to a truly competent explorer – especially one who shares your gift – she could be anywhere by now. Without any information on her whereabouts, or even confirmation she is alive, searching for her would be nothing more than a long, boring fool’s errand.
And for three, you probably wouldn’t even recognize her if you saw her. 
Your entire memory of that meeting is kind of fuzzy!
That was the shortest adventure ever.
Once again, you have nothing to do.
“KABOOM!”
“Hey, Booberry, are you guarding that box? I chugged one of the Detection potions I keep clenched between my thick, rigid lats, and I couldn’t help but notice that fine piece of faille enchested above me.”
“Knock yourself out, Fruitcake.”
“Thanks. I’ve been meaning to get my don on for a while now, if you know what I’m saying.”
“I can imagine. Given that you were naked in a… cave?”
“Naw, a crypt. Crypt-robbing is usually a bit dangerous for my tastes, but today has just been one lucky find after another! I haven’t seen a single skeleton, and I’ve already made over a hundred times my expenses! That is, assuming I can find somewhere nearby that will give me a decent price on all these enchanted family heirlooms.”
“Sounds boring and book-keepy. And getting a decent price in an Imperial city? Good luck with that one, Orsimer.”
“Heh, you’re alright, Windowpane. If you were tangible, I’d reward you with a hearty, jovial slap on the back.”
“I’m touched, or not. So what’s with the clover field?”
“Oh, these? I just keep finding more and more. It must be my lucky day! Even more than it was yesterday.”
Hm…
“Mr. Orc, my fine inferior, you seem like a lucky fellow. Would you perhaps be willing to spin that bottle for me?”
“There aren’t enough ladies here for that, Seabreeze.”
“I don’t mean it as part of your vulgar mating rituals. I mean it as a method of randomization.”
“Your luck appears to manifest by making events that are random from your point of view – such as finding treasure – inexplicably more likely to result in an outcome that is favorable to you. Assumedly, this extends beyond monetary pursuits: any event that is seemingly random will occur exactly the way you want. Ergo, it seems reasonable to assume you could help me locate someone in particular by simply wanting me to find them, and then initiating a random event that will point me in their direction. Now, I may be dead, and slowly losing my mind, but I’m still a Dark Elf and therefore the logic here works out perfectly in every way.”
“I’m not sure I buy it, Seabreeze. Luck is a nice superstition and maybe has some tiny effect on the amazing things I constantly do all the time, but a mer can’t just rely on it like that. If I spun that bottle and it pointed you in even the slightest wrong direction, you would waste months of valuable time and resources searching for someone you’d never, ever find. It’s not a good investment.”
“But if it pointed me in exactly the right direction, then I’d save months of valuable time searching for someone I’d never, ever find otherwise. So they even out perfectly!”
“Just spin the bottle already.”
“Excellent! You are dismissed, lesser-minded creature.”
The dumb orc mutters something stupid about having business meetings and needing “to get his leave on” before taking his poison bottle and tromping away. He doesn’t even thank you for the awesome trick you just showed him. What an asshole! 
Just wait. Someday, he’s going to be hunting someone down, probably for a respectable purpose like revenge, and he’ll remember your ingenious methods and be forced to use them! Just wait.
But for now, you have a competent explorer to find!

Alternatively, you could get a nice laugh out of scaring her out of her armor.
Ordinarily you would never pass up an opportunity to rush headlong into a room, magic blazing in a fear-inspiring show of power that makes the feeble low-races cower beneath you. But this is an experienced adventurer, and you are a terrifying and dangerous-looking ghost! One wrong move could reduce you to an only slightly-superior pile of ectoplasm.
You will have to approach this situation with tact and caution. 
“GREETINGS, adventurer! In honor of your adequacy, I bring you a gift from the Dunmer people!”
“Well?”
“I’m sorry, mister, ah… ghost? I think you have the wrong person. Cat. Thing.”
“Perhaps you didn’t notice, but I am a Dark Elf. We are never wrong. Dunmer science proved it over a thousand years ago.”
“Look, I assure you that I’m…”
“Wait. You’re… you’re that ghost, aren’t you? The one I met the other day? Didn’t a ruin collapse on you?”
“I am incorporeal.”
“Yeah, but that ruin had to have been elven or better.”
“I’m sorry, let me back up. Why are you… you looking for me?”
“Because I’m bored! I’m a guardian spirit with no descendants to guardian. I risk becoming nothing more than a common poltergeist wallowing in regrets and introspection and other terrible things. Thus, I have sought out an experienced adventurer who can regale me with her tales of actual competence and slow my descent into all-consuming ghost-insanity.”
“Okay, yeah, I’m sorry. I wasn’t sure at first, but you really, really, really, really have the wrong person.”
“So, you are in the rain! Most people don’t sit out in the rain. What show of untold hardcoreness drives you to do it?”
“I’m waiting for this day to end.”
“Yeah, using Greater Powers is a pain like that. One time I tried to do my magic sanctuary thing twice in the same day and it broke my arm. What’s recharging for you?”
“I’m not recharging anything, it’s just…”
“I don’t know what to do anymore. When I first came to town, I was on a mission, I believed in myself, and everything just seemed to make sense. I had this friend who kept telling me I could do anything I put my mind to, and I felt good because I really believed him. But then, after I got here, nothing I tried turned out as well as I imagined. I couldn’t make money selling things, I couldn’t solve simple tasks with my magic, and I would have gotten myself drowned trying if a vampire didn’t save me because she wanted to drink my blood. The whole time, though, I just kept myself together by telling myself it was a passing hiccup and everything was going to be okay once I got to the Mages Guild and started learning magic proper like I always wanted. And I was so stupid that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that I didn’t even realize that they were using me and blah blah robbed me and threw me out on the street naked. I blah blah blah but when even that didn’t work, I felt terrible, but blah blah blah blah blah feelings blah but it didn’t help any. Then blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah even though yesterday she seemed like blah blah blah blah blah I didn’t blah blah blah blah blah feelings feelings blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah use me to blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Aaaaaw, guar patties. That apparently is something guardians do!
Welp. You don’t recall ever giving advice and stuff in the past, but if it’s a guardian thing then you must be good at it! And being a Dark Elf, it is customary to display your superiority whenever possible. 
“Oh! Um, welcome back? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”
“Ut! Shut up, I’m about to guardian at you.”
“So I gather you have some kind of problem with things not turning out the way you expect.”
“Kind of. I mean, I get that the-”
“Don’t answer. That was a rhetorical question.”
“It wasn’t actually a ques… I’m sorry, go on.”
“You see… Khajiit person… sometimes life gives you lemons. And when that happens… you need to find some spell that makes lemons explode, because lemons are terrible. I only ate them once and I can say with certainty they are the worst fruit. If life gave me lemons, I would view it as nothing short of a declaration of war.
“In a way, this reminds me of an old children’s tale from my homeland called The Littlest Scrib. You see, once upon a time in Vvardenfell there was this unusually small scrib that wanted to get the fruit at the top of an unusually tall draggle-tail plant. She couldn’t reach the fruit, so her only option was to push the plant down. The little scrib pushed and pushed at the plant, and when that didn’t work she pushed some more.
“And then the warrior-poet-god Vivec stepped on the little scrib as he rushed off the island to stop an invading barbarian force from Cyrodiil. When he got there, he killed all the invaders, blew up their fortress, and burst from the flames driving a dwarven corvette he found inside. He made water solid, did powerslides all the way back to Vvardenfell, and jumped out of the car just as it went flying into a volcano. The end. See?”
“That story was terrible.”
“I guess that’s what I get for expecting a Khajiit to appreciate the depth and intricacy of Dunmer storytelling. Look, the point of the story is that all that stuff about the scrib is stupid, and the tale only gets good once Vivec comes and starts blowing things up.
“If he didn’t show up, then it would just be about the dumb scrib doing the same thing again and again until it either worked or she died – and that would be a terrible moral to teach kids. But because Vivec does cool and exciting things, the story has become a classic piece of folklore printed in children’s books for generations.”
“That’s… great, yeah. But what if someone actually relates to the little scrib in the story? Like, they keep trying to get what they want in life, but everything they do either fails or makes things worse?
“It’s just… what if I’m just not meant to succeed at anything? What if I really am just expendable? When I came to Cyrodiil I wanted to be someone special, or even just useful, but nothing ever works. I couldn’t fix a sign, I couldn’t catch some fish, I couldn’t even deliver a little package for my-”
“Woooooah woah woah woah woah, hold on, fleabag. You’re fixing signs, fishing, and delivering packages?”
“I… yes?”
“You are an atronach, like I was! I saw you take a lightning bolt back in that ruin! The stars made you a spell-absorbing, magicka-hoarding, avatar of arcane chaos!
“Surely, you’ve considered being a witchhunter, like I was.”
“… a witchhunter?”
“You know: a mage who specializes in fighting evil mages. Or magical creatures, Daedra, that sort of thing. The weird shit normal people can’t handle. You’re built for it.”
“Look, as… as neat as that would be, it’s just dumb wishful thinking. I’m not some anti-wizard, or some born magical prodigy, or anything like that. I don’t want to disappoint you, but… I’m nothing special. I’m just a wet, homeless, jobless nobody out in the rain because she has nowhere else to go.”
“Well, I can fix that.”

While you can appreciate the table flipping thing on a symbolic level, this table still weighs like two hundred pounds. It’s not going anywhere.
You turn your attention back to the ghost and ask if he means, like… telekinesis?	
Exactly, he says! The baguettes and butter of any witchhunter’s arsenal! It’s the most basic, most elegant, and most useful form of mysticism: the art of taking something that shouldn’t move, and respectfully disagreeing with its questionable life choices. The simple act of making something happen just because it’s possible, not because it’s likely. Surely, you have experience with it?
You’ve, ah, knocked some things over, you explain. One time you flipped some pews in a burning chapel, but you were in kind of a bad place and don’t think you could do it again. It’s not something you can really control.
No, the ghost says, it’s something you don’t know how to control. You should’ve learned by now that what you know and what is real don’t necessarily overlap.
InnerLioness wrote: FLIP THE FUCKING TABLE! Slajmo wrote: You solved the puzzle Katia, now flip the table!
FLIP IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT
Alright, so the telekinesis is something you don’t know how to control. That doesn’t make it any better. You don’t exactly have access to any kind of training, and you don’t really know where to begin figuring this stuff out on your own. 
The guardian spirit raises a ghostly eyebrow. Surely, if you’ve used telekinesis before, you found something that worked. 
You, er, confess that when you used telekinesis in the past, it was by coming up with obscure derogatory puns comparing yourself to any animal besides a cat. Usually a bird. 
Bird puns, he asks. Yeah, you say. That’s the kind of shit people do for destruction magic, not mysticism, he says. Well you’re sorry, you say. It’s almost like you’re a homeless immigrant with no formal magic education who has no way of knowing this stuff. Honestly, he says, it’d be impressive if you could even knock over a domino using your telekinesis in such a brutish way.
So how am I supposed to do it, you ask?
Like a witchhunter, he replies. Rather than pushing with sheer force of will, push with your mind! Give something a reason to move, rather than supplying the force yourself. Your old angle may have been brutish, but you found something that works. You just have to refine it into something that works well.
So… you want me to reverse-engineer nonsensical bird puns into a cohesive reason that inanimate objects should be able to move by their own free will?
Exactly! And look, there is even an unsolved puzzle on this table! You should solve it telekinetically, he says. I just solved that puzzle literally two minutes ago, you say. The ghost says he doesn’t remember that and he thinks you’re making it up.
Contrast wrote: If he is indeed referring to your flaky Telekinesis, remember to take off your amulet before you attempt to cast it. Wouldn’t want to look stupid. Radar wrote: Take off that amulet. You got some magic to do!
As soon as you reach for your amulet, the ghost holds up a hand to stop you.
Woah woah woah, he says. Is that an amulet of silence? 
Yeah, you say. Is that a… problem? 
No, he says. In fact, that’s a good thing. Why don’t you keep that on? 
Be…cause you need to take it off to cast spells, you say.
The ghost says he’s not asking you to cast a spell. He’s asking you to use magic. An amulet’s not going to stop that.
Wait, hold on a second. You’re saying that an amulet of silence, even when it’s working fine, doesn’t stop all magic?
Well, yeah, he says. If a silencing spell stopped all magic, then it would instantly kill ghosts, daedra, imps, vampires, wisps, or any other kind of magical creature – maybe even Khajiit. All a silencing spell does is keep you from guiding your magic into complex spells.
So if I was, say, wearing an amulet of silence, and then everything around me started uncontrollably catching on fire, even things that shouldn’t burn, that’s… normal?
No, he says, that’s fucking weird. But it’s possible.
It’s like… imagine your magic is a horse. No, a unicorn! This entire analogy just works better with a unicorn.
Maybe you trained it a little, and maybe you keep it in a stable when you’re not using it, but this unicorn is still out there doing its own thing. And if there is a bridge or something over a road, it can just run right under it. Its horn might scrape along the bottom and make some sparks if its head is too high, but that’s not going to stop a fucking unicorn. 
But when you stick a rider on that unicorn, all of a sudden those bridges become a problem. You have more control over what the unicorn does, but you’re gonna waste a ton of energy trying to not fall off of it and also if you try to go under a low bridge it is probably going to take your head off. That’s not a mistake I’m making a second time.
Anyway, I think the bridge stood for something you were talking about, but I don’t remember what. I remember my analogy was amazingly apt, though. That’s basically how you have to look at things if you want to use telekinesis proper. 
So… what you’re saying is that to use telekinesis, the most basic piece of mysticism, I need to reverse engineer bird puns into a logical argument for why inanimate objects should move by their own accord, which I then use to tame a metaphorical unicorn into affecting the world around me? 
Exactly, the ghost says. Told you mysticism was a piece of cake!
Additional resource credits:
Cider – the usual

You, ah… you’ll try, you say. Though you ask the ghost if he has any more specific directions. The whole thing with unicorns and bridges is a little… abstract.
Mysticism is abstract, he says. If you think in concrete terms, you’ll only get concrete results – like things falling downward, or objects stopping when they hit something else. You have to think a little less like the world and make the world a little more like you think, and thinking is rarely concrete. Unless it is. It depends how your mind works. 
You tell him that your mind is kind of a fucking mess. 
He says that’s the best kind. Messes have the most going on, and the most that can happen. You just have to bridge that gap so it happens outside you rather than inside you. Like… an orange.
Like an orange, you repeat. Yeah, he says. 
The ghost neglects to go into any further detail. 

Alright then. If he’s not going to give you any cohesive advice, it’s time to start experimenting with this. He’s right; you’ve used telekinesis before. You just need to focus it. 
Experiment one: weaponizing puns. That seems to be a pretty reliable route for you.

Oh my fucking gods. 
These aren’t even good. Like, half of them are just variants on “wing it”.
But no, it doesn’t look to be having any effect.
Hold on, hold on, hold oooon, the ghost interrupts. You’re still trying to brute force it. 
You ask him what he means. He explains that your amulet is reacting, which means you’re trying to force a full-on, mentally vocalized spell past it and it’s stopping you. Heck, you should be able to feel that. It feels like… like trying to pee when you don’t have a urethra. You tell him you’ve never not had a urethra. He thinks about it for a minute, then concedes that, yeah, maybe that is an experience unique to ghosts.
But you said your magic sets things on fire, right? That’s raw magic, the sort that takes willpower. You’re muscling magicka into energy and then throwing it at the world. 
The old arts like Mysticism are softer; you’re taking energy that’s already there and changing how it presents itself. Lifting an object with pure magical energy would be like trying to push a cart that has no wheels. Instead of applying force, you should be building a wheel! 
I thought this was about unicorns, not wheels, you say.
The ghost tells you that if unicorns and wheels are that different to you, then you might be looking at Mysticism wrong.
Alright, now that seems like a step in the right direction.
When you used fire magic, it wasn’t the cat jokes that were powering it. It was the fact that they hurt you. You were using them and enduring them anyway, and like the ghost said, that’s willpower. You used it to ignite magical energy.
If the other animal jokes were able to trigger your telekinesis, then there must have been some deeper emotion they were triggering. When you used them, you guess you felt… confused. So… maybe telekinesis is powered by confusion.
IT’S NOT WORKING.

You, ah… 
You guess you were speaking to the back of the inn. It just kinda seemed like the right thing to do.
Maybe you’re starting to figure this witchhunter thing out. Or maybe you’re losing your mind. Either one sort of seems like a step up at this point.

Look, you’ve explained this before. Your inventory is a mental abstraction of the items you are carrying, not your abilities! And even if it did show your abilities, it’s just an imaginary list showing what you have. It doesn’t actually store things or allow you to access them. That would be utterly impossible and ridiculous.
You turn your attention back to actual, non-stupid ideas.
You’ve already been analyzing the problem, and so far it hasn’t done anything.
Regardless, you carefully consider what you know. According to the witchhunter ghost, puns and wordplay aren’t the “proper” way to trigger telekinesis, eliminating your one mildly reliable approach to magic. If you’re using telekinesis properly, then the amulet of silence shouldn’t be able to stop you. And apparently, the secret is to “think like a witchhunter”. You’re still kind of figuring out what that means.
Soooo… you guess you’ll try a whole bunch of things.

Yeah, this… this isn’t working. This is stupid.
You tell the insane ghost elf how stupid this is. You can see the amulet flashing and sparkling; it’s blocking all your magic just like it’s supposed to. If you could just, you know, take it off, you could concentrate on the pieces, do the pun thing, and have no problem getting them to move with your mind.
The ghost rolls his eyes, looking a little frustrated by now. That’s not moving, he says, that’s flopping. That’s like downhill skiing on snowshoes, or giving a haircut using a halberd – the sort of shit you’d expect from a nord. Being a witchhunter is about acting with nuance. Throwing nothing but raw energy at a problem gets you nothing but a problem lovingly slathered with cold, sticky energy.
But it worked, you say. With the amulet off, you actually got things to move… a little. If nothing else, it was easier than what you’re trying now.
It wasn’t easier, the ghost explains, you just  knew how to do it. Sometimes the easiest method you know is the hardest method there is. 
It’s like… to someone who only knows how to dig with a spoon, the notion of digging something as large as a trench will terrify them. All they know are spoons, so as far as they’re concerned, digging is simply difficult. The only way they can imagine it getting any easier is if they change – digging with a spoon until they get stronger, faster, and tougher. And the dangerous people, they’ll actually try this.
Everyone who will ever oppose you in life is a crazy, burly dude with a spoon, and you will never be able to outspoon them. Even the powerful people, they’re just spooning harder and more vigorously than everyone else, like hungry orphan children eating soup. Except the soup is power. I’ll level with you here: I have completely lost track of this analogy.
What I’m saying, giant talking cat, is that everyone is stupid. They attain a narrow grasp of reality and live their life as though there is nothing else. But you, me, creatures with imagination – we aren’t constrained by our experiences. We’re inspired by them. If we have trouble digging with a spoon, we build a shovel. If we’re stopped by a wall, we make a door. And if we can’t make a door, we ask ourselves whether we really need an opening to pass through something solid in the first place.
You point out that you’re not a ghost, and that you do need an opening to pass through solid objects.
No – that’s your mistake, he replies. That’s why you’re still not thinking like a witchhunter. You’re trying to do things right, and that’s wrong. Mysticism means taking a step back – accepting that the very laws of reason and logic you abide by are merely one option of many. It means knowing you only see half the picture in a world where everyone else thinks they see the whole thing. It means having the sheer arrogance to have humility. 
That’s why I’m saying you have to think like a witchhunter. You have to be a little wrong to be completely right – to abandon truth in favor of questioning falsehood. If you think something’s the easiest way, you have to know you’re wrong. You have to understand how to stand against the very stance of understanding! You have to know you are inferior; that your knowledge and perceptions will never stand up to the true scope of all possible reality. You have to be a little further from perfect, and embrace that notion.
Can you do that, Jo-Khajiit? Can you make mistakes, fearlessly pursue the worst ideas, and be inferior?
I’m the best fucking fuckup in Cyrodiil.

The ghost says that with close-range telekinesis like this, probably none at all. You’re not actually burning magicka, or doing anything a silencing spell would stop. You’re just holding a simple chain in place. Heck, with practice, an Atronach like you could even use it as a siphon.
O-oh, you say. That’s… that’s shockingly not-bad. Huh.

You are now the Khajiit. 
You were already the Khajiit, but now you are her with resolve. With gusto. Things like that.
For the first time since your visit to the Kvatch Mages Guild, you feel like things might work out. You might have a chance to set everything right; a chance to show Quill-Weave you are a capable and trustworthy individual. Sure, it’ll be dangerous, and you might mess up a little (more) along the way, but… if there’s a chance things will work out – a chance that Katia Managan can take control of this situation – then you’re going to chase it with everything you’ve got. 
And you’ve got a lot right now. You think.
Look, we’ve been over this: the amulet has a Drama Clasp. When you give it a dramatic tug, it just comes undone. Then you click it back together again and it’s good to go.
Seriously, if this had a normal clasp you would’ve broken the chain at least a dozen times by now.
The magic isn’t going to “help you explain to Quill-Weave about how you screwed everything up”. Because after tonight is over, you won’t have screwed anything up.
You motion for your assistant to hand you a pointer.
There is no assistant. That was telekinesis.
Quill-Weave is counting on you to bring back a package from her friend at the bookstore. That package happens to currently be in the possession of a wealthy, evil sorceress with a lifetime supply of mind control pheromones. 
That is a problem. But it’s not an impossible problem.

You have the key to the chapel undercroft. You didn’t want to take the key, but it was shiny, laying right on the table, another Khajiit was watching you… it was a whole thing. 
Point is, you have it now. If Sigrid’s maybe-lackey is to be believed (which is still up in the air at this point), the undercroft has a secret passage to the Mages Guild. You could use that passageway to break in, retrieve Quill-Weave’s package (and anything else you want), and get out. Technically, it wouldn’t even be stealing, since Sigrid is a total bitch. 
According to Stephane, Sigrid will be asleep at 4:00 O’Clock AM. If he’s telling the truth, this whole thing should be a piece of cake. If he’s lying, or this is a trick, or she wakes up or something, though, you’ll need some kind of fallback plan. A mask might protect you from her pheromones, and telekinesis might be enough to protect you from her magic, but your best option is still to remain hidden and get out unseen. 
If you can. 
Right now it’s about 1:06 in the morning. Since a break-in is one of those rare things where you’re not supposed to show up early, that gives you around three hours to prepare, gather supplies, and come up with a plan of action. If you’re lucky, maybe a store or barrack will still be open and you can find some way to earn or trade for any equipment you’ll need. 
You have gotten a few new barterable things since your last trip to a store. Some spices, a bit of bread, and…
You guess this is ectoplasm.

While levitation would certainly be cool and help you out with this whole break-in thing, you can’t find the right… handles, you guess, on yourself? This stuff is all Akaviri to you, but the magic swirly things on your own body look like they’re locked in place pretty hard. 
It just feels different than the inanimate stuff you were moving before. Maybe it has to do with having a soul? Do Khajiit even have souls? You don’t know these things. You probably should.
There is about a 95% chance this will not aid you against Sigrid.
Yeah, like you said, you’d rather avoid an actual confrontation. Magic-absorbing Atronach or no, you’re not ready to go toe-to-clawed-toe with a guild-trained mage – let alone one who can charm people with her very presence. 
But you have been thinking about it, and… if you can get in there while Sigrid is asleep, you’ll have plenty of chances to indirectly cause her harm. You could take a bunch of her money, break all her expensive stuff, or maybe even find some piece of evidence so incriminating that even her pheromones won’t be able to protect her from the law. You’re a witchhunter; you’ll find some way to put Sigrid where she belongs. But your top priority is still to get Quill-Weave’s package and get out alive. 
You know. Do something right for once.
For now, though, you have a break-in to prepare for.
You, ah…
You’ve actually kind of been disregarding your Quest Log and adding whatever came to mind. 
You should probably ignore it and just do one of those things you mentioned up above.

Yeah, this Quest Log could probably use some… anything. For starters, a way to separate what you’re actively doing from what you’re vaguely considering.
Right. That should be enough to get you started.
You’re…. not sure how much you believe that anymore.
Ever since you arrived in Cyrodiil, you’ve been looking all over for people who would be your silver arrow and offer you opportunities that would fix everything. But for every person you’ve met who was actually helpful – like Quill-Weave, Asotil, or the ghost – there have been just as many who were only interested in your money, or your possessions… or your blood, in the case of that one lady who was totally a vampire.
And even if you put those two groups together, there’s a lot less of them than people who just don’t care. Innkeepers, merchants… even Stephane, who you’re not sure if you can trust, is at best using you to further his own agenda. As far as these people are concerned, you’re just a tool.
No. This time, you’re going to stay in control. The world is your tool, and you are its… tool-wielder person. No more wandering, no more begging. From now on, you’re only going to be accepting help from people who genuinely have something you need.

Stompy boots, clanky pauldrons, and slappy leather flaps probably aren’t ideal thiefwear. You need something that will help you actually stay hidden, not give you away. You mark it down on your list.
Even if you can scrape up some money, potions are going to be a little outside your price range. They usually were even when you were growing up – something as simple as a watered-down healing elixir costing over 50 septims. That invisibility potion Quill-Weave trusted you with probably cost at least two hundred.
But… maybe you can find something that will work? Even some food with minor magical properties like you got from Sigrid or Lenka might help out.

You add the lockpick to your inventory list.
Luckily, it looks like the lady from the general store is awake.
Hey, you call over to her. Are you open? She says it’s like one in the morning. You point out that that isn’t an answer. She sighs and says sure. Her bedroom still has stray imps squatting in it and hardwood floor doesn’t make a great sleeping surface, so she might as well stay open all night.
Okay, you say. Cool. Thanks.
Some bread scraps and ectoplasm aren’t going to sell for much. It might be enough for a shitty cloak and small dinner, but hardly a properly-equipped break-in.
With your new telekinesis, though, you might be able to take care of those slaughterfish. You could throw something at them, or haul them up, and instantly have a meaty dinner and some marketable slaughterfish scales. You’ve heard those sell well.
That pointer looks mildly sharp. Try having your “assistant” fling it forth like an arrow.
Well maybe you can still haul them up and let them flop to death on the ground.
You already tried fishing them out with stuff like that! You tried for hours yesterday. The fish chewed through every rope, bucket, or stick that you got near them. Not to mention Khajiit aren’t exactly known for their fishing abilities.
Except that one, apparently.

Unless he was wearing a binder or something in all your previous encounters, you are relatively certain this is not the bartender.
You think.
Rather than open your mouth about it you’re just going to assume this is a different Khajiit.
Soooo… hey, you point out. You can’t help but notice she has some slaughterfish there.
The Khajiit nods. Speaking with a heavy accent, she tells you they were in the well. The guard captain saw them and offered a reward to anyone who took care of them. 
Oh, you say. That’s… actually, you were trying to get them out yourself just yesterday!
She neutrally comments that you did not succeed.
You admit to her that you could have maybe done better. It looks like a harpoon works well! You tell her that you actually tried harpooning them yourself, though your harpoon wasn’t nearly as good as hers.
It was way better than that one, though.
Obscuras wrote: Ask if you can have the scales. And some food. DamienGranz wrote: Be all like “You gonna eat that?”
The Khajiit doesn’t say anything, so you continue.
I, ah, didn’t actually know about any sort of reward when I was fishing for those yesterday, you say. I figured I could just sell their scales, cook their meat, that sort of thing. Also, there was this woman there who wanted to poison the well or something if no one else could kill the fish.
The Khajiit confirms that slaughterfish scales do sell decently, and their meat is… acceptable. She’ll have it later tonight, herself, after she sells their scales and collects the reward. She saw no such woman at the well, though.
Oh, she left a long time ago. I kinda hope she’s in jail now. For putting people in danger, I mean. Like, no offense to you if you’ve been in jail before. For… Khajiit things.
SallowFace wrote: If you start losing your grip on the conversation, comment on the weather. FilthyCasual wrote: Ask that Kajiit why she’s out in the snow with no shoes on.
So! How come you’re, ah, out in the snow with no shoes on?
She points out that it is the middle of summer. And in the far south of Cyrodiil. Snow was not expected.
Yeah, you say. You guess that… would be unusual. You ask if she’s alright, being barefoot in the snow. 
She responds that every second she sits here is pure agony. 
You’re not sure if she’s joking.
The Khajiit continues her dark glare for a while. Eventually, she says she recognizes you: you’re that Suthay-Raht with human-tongue. Scampered around yesterday morning, talking to everyone.
Oh! Yeah, you nervously laugh, that was me. I think I remember you, too. We spoke in Ta’agra, and you compared my speech to… I’m not sure, my parents never taught me the word.
She commends your parents on giving you a respectable upbringing.

Acrobat, she corrects. She helps townshumans and good-wizard Sigrid with odd jobs that need deep-climbs, long-jumps, or sight-in-dark-places or scaring-eye. Fixing weather vanes, finding lost keys, scare away wildlife on jobs too small for fighter’s guild, and the like.
Oh, I guess that kinda stuff makes sense for someone like you.

Hellequin wrote: Grab the rope. You’ll likely need it for your heist. MORTALphoenix wrote: Take the rope from the well it could be useful later, maybe you could even use it to restrain Sigrid later.
You ask the Khajiit if she wants to, ah, take this rope. You saw it here earlier so you’re guessing it’s not hers.
She tells you that, seeing as how it doesn’t belong to her, she’s going to do the responsible thing as a contributing-member of society and not steal it in plain view like some sort of racial stereotype.
You know what she’s trying to say to you, but right now you’re on a quest. Besides, the rope’s been here for a good ten hours by now. If someone needed it more than you do, they would have taken it already. And it’s not like you’re stealing it; you’ll bring it back later. It’s lying on the ground now and you’ll probably drop it back on the ground whenever you’re done with it.
The Khajiit makes a low, growling sound, but is otherwise silent as you gather up the rope. When you’re done, she mentions that it’s wet and late at night, and that she wants to go back home now. 
Unless there is something else Khajiit wishes to waste this one’s time with?

You try to step the conversation back a few… conversation steps. She said something about “good-wizard Sigrid”?
The Khajiit nods. Sigrid is a good wizard. She got rid of all the bad wizards. She is loved by all, makes Kvatch a better city to live in, and is well-known for her generosity.
The two of you are… close, then?
No more than others. The Khajiit explains that when she first came to Kvatch, she didn’t have much. When her food ran out, she looked for work. Sigrid was different from the others in Kvatch. The Khajiit tells you that Sigrid was also one of the first townshumans to give her a job that used her particular abilities.
The elves and men of human lands, they would always assume Rajirra would climb and jump and hunt, just because of fur and claws. But good-wizard Sigrid, she was different. She made point to listen, hear what this one could do, and serve me as I served her.
You point out that, technically though, all the people who assumed she could jump and climb were right. So like, by listening to you explain the same things everyone else assumed, Sigrid wasn’t really…
I am being really super racist, aren’t I?
Yes, the Khajiit says. Unerringly and without respite.
You tell her that you’re going to go now. She says that is probably for the best.
Well, that excursion was a huge waste of time that didn’t even get you dinner.
As is, it’s looking like your best option will be seeing if the shopkeeper will pay you to help with those imps. Your last encounter with imps didn’t go so well, but… well, you think you’ve come a long way since then, especially when it comes to dealing with magic. You can imagine things going a bit better this time.
Or not.
But on the other hand, you also have better control over your fire powers now.
You’re realizing everything you do would be a lot simpler if you had discovered latent ice powers instead of fire. 
The problem is, you’re not armed. You have some tiny claws, fire magic that’s too dangerous to use inside, and one little fear spell you can cast with your weird Khajiit eyeballs. Imps, judging by your last experience with them, have larger claws, as well as lightning magic they can use at no risk to themselves.
You need supplies for the break-in, but you also need to stay safe and not die in the time before it. Imps are dangerous magical creatures; if there was just one then you could scare it away, but if there’s any more than that you might not be able to…

Cider – dramatic flashbacks

Does 1am strike you as a sensible time for a spot of spear fishing? No, that it the time that someone who is so worried about some stranger muscling in on her gig runs ou into the snow without any shoes goes spear fishing.
Reassure her by casually mentioning that you will be leaving town soon, and also mention that before you go you would like to take care of the imp job that the store lady has, but need a partner as it it too big a problem for one Kajit alone…
Hey. Hey! So, are you doing anything tonight?
The Khajiit, who you think third-personed herself as “Rajirra”, tells you that she’s not in the market for a relationship.
I, ah… neither am I. But, like, I was thinking about you, completely platonically, and I’m guessing maybe you feel kind of threatened by me, since I’m sort of going and trying to infringe on all the sort of Khajiit jobs you do with your… Khajiit skills but…
…I am blowing this aren’t I?
Rajirra says she still isn’t entirely sure what you are trying to do, but, yes. Yes. Whatever it is, she is confident you are failing at it.
Imps! The shopkeeper has some imps in her attic! They’re keeping her from getting to like half her store, and she’d probably pay someone to get rid of them. Were you planning to help her?
Rajirra says that she’s not a fighter. Imps and such are dangerous magical creatures, jobs better left to the Fighter’s Guil—
But what about us, together? We can both do the scary Khajiit eye thing, and you have this big pointy stick thing, and I can make telekinetic shields and stuff, and… we could make a lot of money! We could totally take that job right from under the Fighter people’s noses! With our magic and Khajiit skills!
I gravely dislike everything about you, Rajirra says.
Me too, you say, but… we could both benefit from this. So… what do you say? Imp fighting team, and split the reward fifty-fifty?
Seventy-thirty, she says.
Oh, that’s… okay, yeah. That’s probably more fair. Do we shake, or is there some kind of Khajiit thing we—
Stop talking and shake with hand. Then we go to store.
Right. I’ll… I’ll meet you there, and we’ll do this thing.
Yeah, it’s pointless to beat around the bush. She looks exactly like you in every way.
Thanks, you guess?

Right. You refocus on the task at hand. Even with Rajirra’s help, you’re going to need a battleplan.
You’re pretty sure the shopkeeper will accept your help if you offer it, since it sounds like she wants those imps gone and you remember her mentioning the Fighter’s Guild was really expensive. And if she’s looking for a professional, Rajirra is a professional. She just has help from you.
Sure, you guess she could say no and hire professional fighters anyway, but you’re trying not to dwell on all the things that might go wrong. Dwelling on all the things that might go wrong is at least the fifth item down on your list of things to do. This is your first potentially real job in Kvatch, and you’ve got to stroll in there confident and collected, not full of doubts. And if you’re going to show the shopkeeper that you and Rajirra are professionals who can handle this, you’re going to need to show her the specific tactics and ideas you have in mind.
Okay, maybe you’ll… not show her that one. You’re pretty sure that one is a terrible idea that will only end in pain and disaster.
You guess the current plan is that Rajirra and you will burst into the room, do the scary Khajiit stare thing to scare the imps back out the window, and then… close or block it or something so they don’t come back in. This should work fine, assuming there are only two imps up there and you each scare a different one. If there’s a third, you can appropriate some shields for defense and Rajirra’s spear should be enough to… poke it to death, you guess. And if there are somehow even more, then…

Unless she has a better idea?
She tells you that she is planning to go in there, run the imps out – or through – and get a reward. For both of your sakes, she hopes you pull your weight and aren’t useless.
You swear to her you’re not. You just want to make sure you know exactly what’s going to go down so you don’t make any mistakes or… stuff. Not that you usually make mistakes, you’re just trying to make sure this goes well. Like… come up with tactics.
Rajirra tells you not to get yourself killed, and try not to get in eachother’s way. You… admit those are both valid combat strategies. Yeah, you’ll do that.

You have to admit, it is kinda exciting.

Well, maybe not an equal equal, but a seventy-thirty-equal is still better than you’re used to.
Sure, scaring little bat-demons isn’t the most glamorous thing in the world, and you’re not sure how much your partner likes you, but still: she seems reliable and you’re pretty sure the two of you have thought this through enough that it won’t backfire disastrously.

To break the ice a little, you decide to tell Rajirra a bit about yourself. You explain that you just came to Cyrodiil about a week ago, trying to set out and make a new life. You’ve been trying to make some deliveries to Kvatch for a good friend of yours, though the first time you sort of got robbed on the way there, and the second time you, ah… got robbed after you arrived. You guess when you came here you weren’t expecting so much… robbery.
This one has never noticed it, Rajirra says. Perhaps the problem is with you.
You admit that you might’ve made some mistakes in that regard. Like, trusting the wrong people, or maybe drinking copious quantities of the wrong things at the wrong time. But you still-
Rajirra cuts you off, saying she’s not interested in your excuses. She means a problem with your expectations. You said you came to Cyrodiil seeking new life; such implies an old life, yes?
I… yes, I had one. But it wasn’t one I wanted.
Rarely life is, Rajirra says. But, whatever life you held back in your homeland, it seemingly let you last this long, and presumably involved less risk, failure, and tediously inconvenienced “friends”. Perhaps in this old life you had found the high extent of your abilities, and there is only folly in these attempts to move beyond it or pursue some flawed human conception of dignity.
I don’t – h-hey! First of all, that’s dismal and stupid. You’re stupid. Second of all, it’s not a human conception of dignity, it’s a pretty Elven and Argonian one too! And third, you moved to Cyrodiil too! You said so yourself!
Rajirra specifies that she didn’t move to Cyrodiil, she fled to Cyrodiil. A functional Khajiit runs away from danger, not headlong toward it. And she’s not stupid, she’s a realist. She has no delusions of gaining great respect in human lands and becoming some fairytale princess living in a castle.
I’m not trying to become a p-
Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to call you stupid. This is just kind of something I care about. Are we still friends?
We were never friends, Rajirra says.
Okay, but like… are we less friends than we were before?
No, she says.
I’ll take it.

Oh my gods, just because the two of you are Khajiit doesn’t mean you’re going to break into the place.
See? She knows you’re here, and what you are doing. Everything is legal and fine.
You put on your best formal-face and tell the shopkeeper you are here to inquire about a job. Specifically, a job regarding those imps in her attic. You explain that you and your fr-acquaintance have a plan to get them out, assuming she still needs them out and is paying.
The shopkeeper nods and says you came just in time. If you can go any lower than the 200 septims Mr. Fighter’s Guild over there is asking for the job, it’s yours. You ask if 199 septims is okay. She asks if maybe you could go a little lower, to account for any inventory losses. 
You ask her what she means. You know, she says. Things that might get damaged if you fight the imps. Oh, you say. Yeah. That’s, that’s ah… what you assumed she meant, and nothing else. Let’s say 190. 
The shopkeeper asks you what your plans are. You explain that the two of you are going to enter the attic like a pair of respectable Khajiit, and then tackle the problem head-on. Like Khajiit, or any of the other races in Cyrodiil.
Yep. Just like a pair of Khajiit.

Yeah, cause what she is doing right now is totally not a racial stereotype. Moofius wrote: Wait! Aren’t we trying to get the imps to go out through the window? The window Katia-Clone is going to climb into?! Stop her! 
Wouldn’t it be better to go in through the door, have the imps attention (and eye contact) and shoo them out?
Woah, woah, woah, you hiss. What are you doing? Rajirra tells you that she’s climbing up to the window. Yeah, you noticed. But like… people are watching. The shopkeeper is right over there, watching you right now, and if you asked, she’d probably let you use the stairs like an ordinary-
Rajirra cuts you off with a glare and clarifies that she’s climbing up to the window for reconnaissance, so you can see what you’re up against before you go barging headlong into the room. The only thing she’s planning to steal is a quick glance through the window.
Oh, you say. That’s… yeah, that’s not what you thought was going on here. 
Rajirra says she’s going to resume climbing now, unless it has a better idea?
Actually, yeah. Yeah, you do. You tell her to hold on a minute – you have an idea that should let the two of you scout out the room without being seen, without any potentially dangerous climbing, and without looking like some kind of thief.
It’ll be really cool, and involves magic. You’ll see. 
You scurry over to the shopkeeper and ask her if she has any hand mirrors. She tells you no, explaining that most of her cosmetic supplies are up in the second-floor storage room. You ask her if she has any other reflective things, like a very polished piece of metal or or something. No, she tells you, the town smith is the main supplier of metal goods. You ask her if she has any kind of dark glass, or shiny rock, or anything else small or reflective thing you could borrow for a minute. No, she replies; like she just said, her stock on that sort of stuff is somewhat limited at the moment.
Nevermind! Just… keep doing what you were doing.

Better to have a weapon now when we need it, than gold latter if we succeed. She’d pay us less, make a sale, and get rid of the imps and we’d have a weapon or shield to better face the imps. It’s a win win.
You try to alleviate some of the awkwardness by striking up a conversation with the shopkeeper. You explain that, despite being a trained professional who can totally handle this, you’re looking to make this as safe as possible and are wondering if you could, like… pre-buy some supplies for this, pre-using the money you’ll get after you finish it.
She points out that she’s a shopkeeper, not a banker, and doesn’t usually deal in loaning things out.
You know, but you’ll have the money right as soon as you’re done. And your chances of getting those imps out (for less than the Fighter’s Guild!) will be a lot better if you have a weapon or shield or something.
The shopkeeper finally shrugs and says she supposes she can make an exception; after all, she’s not making any money with half her wares being held hostage upstairs. 
This is a general store, she explains, so she doesn’t have a whole lot in terms of weapons and armor. But, if she remembers right, you’re a mage – or at least a talkative wannabe – and she does have a few spell scrolls on hand. From left to right here, she has a basic healing spell, a skeleton summoning spell, and a low-tier shock resistance. She has a scroll of invisibility, too, though that one would eat up almost your entire half of the reward.
Right, you say. Your entire half.
You admit that you’ve never used a magic scroll before. Am I supposed to study it and learn the spell, or does it magically teach me what I need to know, or…?
It’s just magically charged paper, she says. Mages back west tend to use wands – these are the same thing but more disposable. An enchanter already formed the spell and imbued it with the necessary magicka. You just need to peel off the safety sticker, read the release phrase off the scroll, and let it out. It’s not hard; even a parrot can do it.
Huh. Yeah, now that you think about it, you remember reading that was one of the reasons they’ve been wiping all the birds out. So how much money are we talking for magic scrolls like this?
The shopkeeper says there’s not a lot of demand for magic supplies in Kvatch, so she’ll probably be sitting on these for a while if she doesn’t ditch them now. How’s 20 septims each sound?
You, ah, you’ll definitely consider it. You should run the idea by your partner first, to make sure it doesn’t conflict with anything she has planned. You thank her again for the help, and promise you and your friend will have those imps handled and the shop accessible again before she can say “impless”!
Impless, she says. You tell her it was a figure of speech. This is gonna take you like half an hour, at least. 
You ask the Fighter’s Guild member if there’s any hard feelings, what with how you and your friend totally scored the job and now he’s just gotta sit back and watch you be all professional.
No hard feelings at all, he says. Your boldness is admirable, and he looks forward to seeing what you can do.
Oh, you say. That’s… thanks, you guess.
You tell the Fighter’s Guild guy that you’re sorry and you hope you didn’t take a job he really needed or anything like that.
He tells you that it’s no big deal, really.
Once Rajirra is back down the rope, you ask her what she saw. She tells you that there are just two small imps, which wouldn’t be difficult for either of you, alone. You nod and ask if there’s any more preparations she wants to make before going upstairs and dealing with them. Personally, you were thinking about pre-buying some spell scrolls, just in case. Is that a thing she’d be interested in, too? The shopkeeper said they could be used by anyone, not just wizardy-people. 
Rajirra tells you that, really, she’s only interested in getting paid and getting out of here. Right now, she has to start clearing a path through that barricade to get up the stairs, since you apparently didn’t even start on that while she was scouting. You tell her you’re sorry; you’re just trying really hard to make sure nothing goes wrong here.
She repeats herself slowly, saying the imps shouldn’t be difficult for either of you, alone. The two of you have a match in numbers and superiority in tactics, and she is completely certain this won’t be a tenth as difficult as you’re making it out to be.
You tell her you really hope it isn’t, because you’re tired of situations always taking a turn for the worse when you enter them. She puts on a reassuring scowl and tells you to stop expecting the worst out of everything.
You ask her why, because things usually turn out for the best? No, she replies, because it’s annoying to listen to well-manicured kittens whine about how miserable their lives are.

Cider – all the perspectivey panels

Okay, imagine you are in a dark alley, late at night, all alone. Except suddenly, you’re not alone: a dark figure flows out from the shadows. You can make out that he’s a cloaked man at about the same time you see the naked sword in his hand and the crossbow slung over his shoulder. He tells you that if you give him all your money and valuables, you won’t get hurt.
Your hands are ice when they reach into your pocket, shaking with fear. But then, they harden with steely anticipation. Instead of your valuables, you pull out your tiny, half-inch-long dagger and wield it threateningly. 
Yeah. That’s what claws are like.

You still remember your run-in with the imps from a few days ago. Specifically, you remember the gigantic bolts of lightning they hurled at you. Your magic absorption powers might help, but with your luck you’d still rather play it safe than sorry. 
With the shopkeeper’s permission, you pre-buy the magic scroll of Lightning Shield. 
Just to be one hundred percent official and professional, you write her a formal and professionally signed I.O.U.. Professionally.
Yeah, the rest of those scrolls are Summon Xivilai. If they’re anything like the Xivilai wands back home, they’re way outside your price range and not really intended for combat scenarios.

You let Rajirra know that you bought a scroll of Shock Shield. You know, in case of either of you need it. She flatly congratulates you and continues clearing the stairs. You use your telekinesis to help her out a little. 
Just to make sure, you ask her if she’s completely certain she only saw two imps up there. Since, you know, your plan relies on there just being two. She replies that she is. You ask how she can be; if it’s a storage room, wouldn’t there be barrels and stuff they could be hiding behind? Rajirra says that she. Is. Certain. You nod, and say you don’t have any reason to not believe her. You’re just kind of nervous about it, since you had this thing recently where you thought everything was going good, but then it turned out it was just the effects of a charm potion, so you just want to check that she’s completely –
Rajirra shoots you a glare that says that you should stop asking if she’s certain about the imps. 
You very, very carefully sneak up the stairs, trying to keep your footsteps as light as possible. In the tense silence, you can hear your heart pounding in your ears. 
Rajirra asks what you’re doing. You tell her that you’re being sneaky, so the two of you will have the element of surprise. She tells you to knock it off; she can hear you breathing down her back and it’s creepy. 
Sorry, you say. You just want to make sure everything goes according to plan and there aren’t any more unexpected surprises. 
Nothing ever goes according to plan in a fight. It (she gestures at you) must act quickly and on intuition, and if it has the right kind of intuition, it won’t die. If its reactions are poor, it will.
That’s… a little grim and depressing, you say, but it sounds like she has experience. You ask her if she was ever a soldier.
No, she says, just quick enough to think on her feet and deal with danger. 
Just roll with it.
You, ah… you guess you’re probably stressing over the details a little too much, yeah. You tell her you’re going to talk about something else. You ask her what kind of fighting style she has. Like, you want to make sure you know what to expect from her when she gets in there, and-
Rajirra interrupts you to remark that she just climbed out of a well, yet somehow it manages to seem both less circular and less like a brick wall than this conversation.
You tell her you’re sorry; you get talky when you’re nervous. But you just want to figure out if she’s more of a frenzied berserker who’s going to rush forward, or a careful and precise-
Yes, she replies. Sure, those.
Oh, that’s… okay. 
Behold! Here we are. Rajirra asks if you’re ready, or if you need a few more minutes to get lost in panicking and overthinking things. 
Wow, you say. You already said you were sorry. 
Yes, she says, but every moment it delays is another moment she isn’t getting paid for having endured this. Is it ready?
Just stick to beaning them over the head with whatever heavy non-breakable object you can control with telekinesis and if you absolutely -must- use a fire spell, make sure it’s a concentrated short-range attack, like a flamethrower to the eyes – nothing that’s going to fly away from you and burn the house down. 
The worst thing that could possibly happen to you here is you get a little bit beat up/electrocuted. No pain, no gain.
You remember everything she told you, about how this is going to be easy. You try to remember everything the dark elf ghost taught you about witchhunting, just in case things go south. You remind yourself that, if anything does go wrong, you’ve got a scroll for protection, and a well-armed partner who can back you up. 
You also remind yourself that this is only your first stop tonight, and that you’ve still got matters to attend to after this. Very important matters.
You’re ready.
Rajirra asks why you just ruined that pair of gloves. You lie and say it was so you could get your claws out easier. You know. Claw fighting. You’re all about that.

It, ah, looks like all the fires went out when the imp died. At least, all the fires started by the imp’s magic.
There are a couple dying embers of your own fire lying about, but nothing big enough to be a hazard. All of your spells either hit the imp or went out the window.
And you’re preeeeetty sure this window isn’t facing toward the super-flammable orphanage. You’re just gonna kinda hope you’re right about that.
You’re… honestly not sure how you’re supposed to feel right now. 
In all the stories you’ve read, this is the part where the love interest is supposed to burst through the door and sweep the main character off his feet with desperate statements about how she’s glad he’s okay. Then, the scene cuts to something else and it’s left pretty vague exactly who is expected to mop up all the blood, or at what point the main characters are supposed to shrug off the huge battle and be like, “okay, back to what we were doing before”. You don’t really have much reference for how this whole post-battle part is supposed to be hitting you.
As for how you actually feel…
Well, you did it.
Maybe it was just a fluke, or the beefy imp’s dumb fault for relying on magic without realizing you could absorb it, but for at least 100 seconds there you were a telekinetic, spell-slinging, wisecracking badass. You were like someone you’d look up to, instead who you actually are. This is like the biggest achievement of your life, and if you can keep this level of badassery up through the rest of tonight, things are only going to get even better. You feel good about this, and you deserve to celebrate. If you searched through those two unbroken crates, maybe you could find something to drrrrrr-
-rrroooooookay, that answers your question about when it’s time to forget about the fight and move on. You’ve gotta collect that bounty, hope that agreed-upon “ten septims worth of damages” isn’t negotiable, and finally go get your stuff back from Sigrid.

You can understand Rajirra running away – especially since, as strange as it feels to admit, she was less suited to a magical fight than you were. But even then, she fed you bad information, she didn’t even leave you with a weapon, and you did most of the work here. You think that deserves a little more than 30%. Like, at least 40%. 
Oh. Right. There was also the whole “lock you in here to die” thing.
Forty-five percent. No lower.

After making it through that entire fight without any of your fire spells hitting the walls, you aren’t going to burn the building down to get through a door. 
If it’s just something jammed through the handle, though, it should be no problem to…
Oh. Right. You guess if builders hadn’t foreseen this, anyone with the slightest bit of magical ability could go wherever they wanted by simply unlocking doors from the other side.
From the mark on the door, you’re guessing there’s a silver ribbon or something running between the boards. You’re more than capable of jostling the door itself with telekinesis, but the magic on the other side of it feels all weird and distorted. Telekinesis probably isn’t gonna help you here.
That, on the other hand…
The hinges are definitely accessible, but you don’t think the lockpick could survive the 24 screws necessary to take them off. If you want to tackle the hinges, your best option would be to find something pointy and sturdy you can use to pound the pin out. Maybe a proper turnscrew, or a chisel. With the pins out, the disconnected door should slide right toward you.
You just exploded a giant fire demon in a room full of landmines by punching its head off with a burning fist. You felt unstoppable. You hate this wooden door so much. 
You guess you’ll go look for some tools.
Yeah, that’s… honestly, you think you were already planning to just keep the armor set and never compete. At least the “incomplete raiment” will give you an excuse so you don’t have to feel bad about bailing. Heck, the Arena Master would probably even appreciate it, knowing that one of his suits was damaged in actual life-or-death combat. 
Bon voyage, leather gloves. We barely knew ye. 
Then again, that dance competition is going to be your only way to pay Quill-Weave back if this Mages Guild heist goes horribly wrong and backfires disastrously, which we can all agree is absolutely, undeniably going to happen. If your raiment is incomplete, the Arena Master will probably charge you for replacement parts, which you can’t really afford. 
But you can, ah, probably fix these gloves? Yeah. They just need a little TLC.
You put the shredded scraps of charred leather in your inventory. And mark them as broken gloves to remind you what the heck they are supposed to be. You’ll find some way to solve this later.

Jumping out of Quill-Weave’s window and spraining your ankle gave you just enough acrobatics experience that you now know not to jump out of second-story windows. This lesson was further reinforced yesterday, when you broke both legs jumping off the roof of a two-story building. 
Seriously, falling off buildings these last two days has taught you two very important things: first, you always land on your feet, and second, your feet hate that. If you want to get safely out through the window, you’re going to need some kind of rope.

Okay, no, that’s… as much as you’d  like to go find Rajirra and at least have a stern discussion regarding the whole “locked you in here with a monster” thing, you have bigger fish to fry. You remind yourself that your top priority is still breaking into the Mages Guild so you can steal back your stuff, complete Quill-Weave’s courier job, and prove once and for all that you are capable of accomplishing simple tasks without messing up. 
You might have gotten a little sidetracked, what with all the robberies and nightmares and fighting magic-users, but your primary goal is still to get that package back to Quill-Weave. You’re going to get into that guildhall, as soon as possible, no matter what it takes – even if it entails ignoring something you’d like to do, or doing something you’d rather not.
Holy shit, absolutely nothing about this was a good idea.
It turns out it’s actually pretty hard to remove something’s entire intestinal tract with your bare hands and fashion it into usable rope. The longest intact piece of imptestine you got out of this is about three feet long, the whole attic smells like a slaughterhouse, and you kinda feel like you’ve desecrated a corpse in some way divine figures would disapprove of. The only solace you receive from this action is the knowledge that you very briefly dismissed it as stupid before doing it anyway.
You guess you’ll try a different approach.

The hinge pin is easily accessible, but like you said, it’s pounded in there pretty hard. Your telekinesis isn’t particularly strong, nor very good at rotation. If it was, you’d have, like, an awesome-looking magical spinning barrier around you. Constantly. 
Your best bet for disassembling these hinges is to find some proper tools, or something else sturdy and pointy you can use to tap the pin out. 
Those are calipers. They’re basically pliers that are too fragile to use for anything more intensive than measuring something’s length.
And like… people can see lengths. You don’t know why someone would want a tool for it.
The imp didn’t drop down from the roof, it was just hiding up in the ceiling rafters. Even if there was a hole in the roof, though, you’d need some sturdy rope to get up to it. And then once you were up there, you’d be on the roof and need even more rope to get down. Really, you’re not feeling the whole get-on-the-roof thing. 
Alex wrote: >Katia: Hey Kat know what gets people’s attention? Levitating corpses outside their window. Dah wrote: Seriously, just chuck the corpse out the window and use it as a landing cushion.
That, on the other hand, you… guess you could see working. Other than the bony bits, this dead imp is starting to get kneaded into a fairly soft cushion. The biggest challenge would be getting it through the window, since it’s pretty large and too heavy for your telekinesis. Also, landing on it would make a huge mess, but that’s starting to matter less at this point.

Hm. This linen is pretty thin, badly burnt in places, and soggy with blood. You might be able to twist and knot it into an okay rope if you doubled it over, but at that point it would be getting pretty short. 
You could try flying on it like a magic carpet, but your telekinesis isn’t really strong enough to lift your entire bodyweight, or broad enough to hold an entire piece of cloth into shape. It would probably be more like holding yourself in a giant sack that slows your fall slightly, assuming you didn’t just rip through the bottom and come crashing down in a heap.
As for the crates themselves, if the first one’s any indication, they’re just full of house supplies – plates, candleholders, that sort of thing. It’s nothing that would be useful to you, and most of the stuff in here is already cracked and broken – probably from all the magical explosions going off nearby.
Looks like this hand mirror made it out okay, though! That’s seven years of bad luck you don’t have to deal with.
Luck probably isn’t real anyway.
Anyway, most of your ideas for getting out of this room are complicated, horrible, and probably going to end in grievous personal injury. Maybe this is one of those instances where you need to think like a witchhunter and find the simple, direct solution nobody would think of, like an easy magical way to push your telekinesis through the silver-lined door, or pass yourself down through the floorboards, or…

You stomp on the floor and call down that the imps are all gone, and that you’re locked in the attic. Also, please bring a clean towel. Like, preferably one that you don’t care about. 
Sweet ass-fucking mother of Talos, the shopkeeper says. 
You quickly explain that things got a little out of hand. First it turned out there were three imps roosted in here instead of two, and then the last one was ten feet tall and knew all the fire magic. You’re sorry for breaking her, like, everything, but you weren’t exactly expecting you’d have to fight a giant death monster one-on-one. 
Uh-huh. So, from the way this spear looked like it was there specifically to bar the door closed, the shopkeeper says she’s going to assume that your friend’s story about “leaving you her weapon and an expensive Summon Storm Golem scroll while she ran to get her poisons” was complete bullshit.
Woah woah woah, you say, she told you that she… she said that… no! She didn’t do any of that! She’s just a fucking jerk who ran and locked the door behind her as soon as stuff got bad. 
Done and done.
You also whisper a quiet “thank you” to the silver-lined door for keeping you from telekinetically moving that spear. Not having to prove your side of the story is a real silver lining here.
Oh wow that pun is amazing. You wish the shopkeeper knew enough context for you to say it out loud. 
You turn your attention back over to her. The initial shock of her decimated storeroom seems to have worn off, and she is now making an audible list of damages. She notes that most of the food is burnt, the cloth rolls have been reduced to scraps, every single mirror seems to be broken…
On the bright side, at least her surplus rope, grappling hooks, and climbing harnesses survived unharmed.
She knows the two of you agreed to ten septims to cover any potential damages, but this is a lot of damage. Essentially everything she had in storage is burnt, shattered, or soaked in an inch of blood, and that wasn’t exactly something she budgeted for. On the other hand, you basically did fight the King of All Imps in here, so it wouldn’t be –
It, ah, sounds like we’re going to talk about business, you call up to her. You’re pretty sure the two of you should be performing these sorts of negotiations down here at a counter. Like proper, professional businesspeople.
Anyway, she reiterates, there’s a lot more damage than she anticipated. Granted, she hadn’t realized the imp problem had been that severe, or else she probably would have had the Fighter’s Guild deal with it sooner. Hell, if they’d known how bad it was, they probably would’ve asked more than 200 for the job.
You ask if she’s trying to change her end of the bargain. No, she says, a deal’s still a deal. But if it’s all the same, maybe you’d consider letting her pay you with something from her stock, rather than raw gold? It’d be less of an impact on her, financially, and it already sounded like you were looking to turn around and spend the reward here anyway.
Well, you admit that was the plan back when you thought you were going to be walking away with about 40 septims after giving Rajirra her cut and paying for the magic scroll. 170 is more than you’ve ever had to your name at any given point, though, and you aren’t even sure what sort of things people would, like… spend that on. You ask her what it was that she was planning on paying you with. Maybe more scrolls?
That depends entirely on you, she says. Was there anything in particular you were looking for?
You, ah, mention that you could use a new outfit. Your current gear is kind of noisy, cumbersome, and – as of a few minutes ago – brightly colored, and you’d like something a bit sneakier. Not that you’d use it to steal anything, of course; you’d just like to avoid any more unwanted, life-or-death fireball exchanges with people who actually know what they’re doing.
The shopkeeper nods and says she understands; the best confrontations are ones you can avoid. If it’s stealth you’re looking for, actually, she might have just the thing.
Every few years or so, the town will get a travelling hedgemage passing through looking to offload a bunch of stuff they made as enchantment practice. It’s rarer these days, what with the rising price of magetallow candles, but when one shows up she’ll usually snag a few dozen bits of magic clothing and jewelry.
Isn’t enchanted clothing usually worth, like, tens of thousands of septims, you ask? You’ve seen it for sale in the Guilds back in Hammerfell, and the prices were never exactly in the 170-septim range. 
Those were probably professional, Guild-produced pieces, she explains. Most of what she gets from private enchanters are little things, like a linen skirt that makes you jump a few inches higher, or a wool hat that clears up nearsightedness. The soul powering the enchantment is usually something weak, like a rabbit or wild boar or whatever else the enchanter had been hunting for dinner. Like she said, most of what she gets are practice items: quick things made to help the enchanter work out flaws in his or her technique.
The piece she has in mind for you, though, is more of an… experiment. 
An… experiment?
As in, a magic item with a caveat. Technically it’s probably worth more than 200 septims, the shopkeeper says, but she’s been sitting on it for years without a buyer. 
The enchanter who sold it to her called it The Cloak of Gray Tomorrow. Long and short is: it’s an invisibility cloak. A powerful one, too; last time she tested it, the spell lasted almost an hour. 
An hour! That would be more than enough time to… escape from all sorts of danger while doing perfectly legal activities. Why wouldn’t something like that sell?
That’s where the caveat comes in, she says. While you’re invisible, everything is fine and the cloak is amazing. But as soon as you deactivate the enchantment, take off the cloak, or otherwise stop the invisibility spell, though, you go completely blind. 
Like… forever?
The shopkeeper snorts. Nobody would use a magic rag that makes them go blind forever. No, you just lose your sight for as long as you were invisible, down to the second. The longer you stay invisible, the longer you can’t see afterwards, and by the time your sight comes back, the invisibility spell has recharged. 
Does that… make the enchantment use less magicka? Pairing a good thing with a bad thing like that?
No, the shopkeeper says, I’m pretty sure it just makes the cloak require twice as much power as it would otherwise. Hell, an enchantment that strong probably took thousands of septims worth of materials to make and needed a Daedra soul to power it. I asked the enchanter why anyone would waste that much on an invisibility cloak that blinds you, and she just said that it “seems fair that everyone else should get to be invisible too”.
Look, Sigrid did a lot to show me and the others in town that magic wasn’t all bad, but frankly: mages are weird. Every single one of them.

It is better to ask for money, that you have enough to purchase new books for the Quill Weave.  
Well, on one hand, this magic cloak is basically the textbook definition of “backfire disastrously”. Long-lasting invisibility might increase your chances of getting into the Mages Guild unspotted, but if anything at all goes wrong during the break-in, like you take too long or Sigrid wakes up and dispels your invisibility somehow, the cloak is only going to make things a thousand times worse and probably shatter any hope you’d have of salvaging the situation or even escaping alive. And on top of that, this is a general store; you could just as easily use your earnings to get some quieter, darker-colored clothes and maybe even that short invisibility scroll in case of an emergency. It would certainly be more reliable than some finicky magic cloak made by an eccentric enchanter.
On the other hand, though, a fully-fledged invisibility cloak would…
No. On the other hand, you don’t actually have to go through with the break-in at all. 
With Rajirra out of the picture, you just earned 170 septims. That’s enough to buy a new copy of the book you ruined, stay at the inn until Asotil comes back, and return to Quill-Weave having accomplished absolutely everything she sent you to Kvatch for. While the shopkeeper might want to pay you in store credit, she’s stood by her bargain thus far and would probably give you your payment in raw gold if you asked. 
You could just… walk.
Sure, it wouldn’t be glamorous. There’d be no big, triumphant return where you reveal to Quill-Weave that you’ve gone above and beyond her simple courier job and are able to pay her back for all the damage you did to her home. You’d be costing the shopkeeper a lot of money, holding her to your original agreement even after destroying her entire storage room. And Sigrid… well, you’d leave her be, and just become another one of the many people she was able to rob and abuse without consequence. But in exchange for these things, you could succeed. For the first time in your life, you could make it through a simple, stupid job without fucking it up by trying to make everything a little better.

Ask if the blindness can be cured at a temple like a curse.
I’d like to know more about the cloak, please. Like, what type of invisibility spell does it use? I remember there being a few types, some breaking easier than others. 
The shopkeeper nods and says it’s a good question. From what the enchanter told her, it’s the sturdier type of invisibility. What’s it called, the one that makes a tight suit of light that bends around your body? She can’t remember the spell’s name, but she distinctly recalls that it’s not the traditional Invisibility spell, which just creates an easily shattered illusion that the place you’re standing in is empty.
Well, okay then, what about the blindness, you ask? You said it lasts up to an hour, depending how long you stay invisible – could a healer or potion cure it ahead of time? Will the blindness take effect immediately if the cloak falls off or something? And, if I’m an Atronach, could I possibly resist the blindness?
The shopkeeper admits she hasn’t tested the cloak too extensively – she might be living in Cyrodiil, but this deep-end magic stuff still gives her the heebie-jeebies. To answer your questions, though: first time she tested the cloak, she had a healer on-hand for emergencies. Traditional healing spells didn’t do anything for the blindness, but Oleta did manage to chip away at its duration a little with Dispelling magic. Taking the cloak off seemed to trigger the blindness the same as deactivating the spell any other way. And as for Atronachs being able to absorb the blindness, she’s not sure. She’s only ever known a few people born in the Atronach’s month, and the last of them died of old age years ago. Basically, back when inns started giving out free condoms on Heart’s Day, your kind instantly went from half the new births to none of the new births. 
That makes sense, you guess. You confess you’ve only ever met one other Atronach, and he was long-dead too. The shopkeeper asks what you mean by “was long-dead”. You say it’s complicated. It’s a thing. 
Dokbot wrote: Ask if the cloak effect stack if you rapidly use it. SpiritOfSea wrote: Ask may you make people blind by putting that cloak on them telekinetically? Appleloft wrote: This cloak requires some field testing.
So, if someone were to, say, wear the cloak for thirty minutes, take it off, then put it right back on again, would the invisibility reactivate for the rest of that hour, while they were blind? Could they spend the next thirty minutes blind and invisible while the cloak recharges the first thirty minutes, after which they repeat the process, near-permanently invisible but spending every other half-hour blind? Alternatively, if you wore the cloak for forty minutes, then put it back on to become blind-and-invisible, would the twenty-minute blindness merge with the forty-minute blindness such that they’re invisible and sighted for forty minutes, invisible and blind for twenty minutes, and visible and blind for only twenty minutes more? 
The shopkeeper explains, again, that she hasn’t tested the cloak too extensively, let alone that… pathologically. From what she’s determined, though: when the cloak blinds its user, it turns completely inert for just as long. Even if the invisibility spell was deactivated early, any attempts to reactivate it won’t work until enough time has passed for the blindness to have worn off. So, crazy plans to circumvent the enchanter’s weird caveat probably won’t bear fruit. Is that everything?
Er, no, you say. You apologize for all the questions; you just think you’re about to do something really stupid and, since there’s pretty much no talking yourself out of it, you’re trying to come up with an approach to it that’s as un-stupid as possible. So the vibe you’re getting about this Cloak of Gray Tomorrow is that it’s not too dangerous if it’s used in short bursts so you can get to a safe place and let it recharge, as opposed to trying to get everything done in one go and having it blink out on you as soon as an hour is up. What about offensive uses? Could you, like, telekinetically throw the cloak over someone, and then pull it off a few seconds later to blind them?
Okay, the shopkeeper warns, you’re getting a little too far into magethought now. If you want to blind someone in a fight, you throw a regular sheet over them. That way, they’re instantly blinded and you don’t have to worry about an angry, invisible aggressor.
Oh. Right, you say. You forgot that was a thing too.
Any other questions, she asks? Or are you ready to make your call on the payment?
Can I try it on?
She points out that “can I try on the invisibility cloak” is one of those lines they very specifically warn students about in Shopkeeper College.
Do you trust me?
Well, worst case scenario here is that you silently accept your payment for the imp job, leave, and she can go to bed. Anyway, she supposes it makes sense that you’d want to get a handle on the cloak’s nuances; make sure it’s something you can deal with and all that. 
You half-chuckle. Please, you say, you’re no stranger to weird magic, you just want to make sure it still works. For an invisibility cloak that’s actually within your budget, you’re pretty sure you can handle whatever weirdness this Cloak of Gray Tomorrow throws at you. 
Oh what the fuck! 
This isn’t even gray. What is this color scheme even called? It’s like… festive holiday disaster. 
Well, it’s called the Cloak of Gray Tomorrow, the shopkeeper says. The implication isn’t necessarily that the cloak is gray, but that tomorrow is gray. As far as she figures, the name makes sense.
Sure, it makes technical sense, you say, but there are still rules of good taste when it comes to naming things. If you’re gonna put “gray” in the something’s name, you can’t just carry that theme halfway and then dump it by the side of the road.
She shrugs and says you don’t have to call it that if you don’t want to. It’s not like it’s written on the cloak anywhere.
Maybe… maybe it’s called gray because of that particular silver lining?
What, the shopkeeper asks. It was a joke, you say. Like, the fact you can change its name is a silver lining, and silver is like… you know what, nevermind, everything about this joke was a mistake.
But seriously though, I was kinda hoping it’d be dark gray or something, so I’d be a little less obvious if I have to hide in a corner, blinded, waiting for the invisibility spell to recharge. The waiting periods with this are going to be kind of tense, though. Do you have, like, maybe a book I could read?
A book to read while blind, the shopkeeper deadpans. 
Maybe something in nightwriting, you ask? You can read the basic type and some of the Level Two stuff. It’s kinda something you pick up when you have extremely fickle and self-destructive magic powers built into your eyeballs.
She… honestly, nobody’s ever asked before. She vaguely recalls a traveler once pawned one here, and can’t remember anyone ever buying it. She’ll check to see if it’s still on the shelf. 
So, how do you, like… turn it on?
The hood, she calls over to you. Flip it from down to up. 
Woah. That’s, ah, weirder feeling than I was expecting. The blindness makes everything turn black, though, not gray. That name was just really fucking awful.
Better than “Festive Holiday Disaster”, she says. So you’re good with the cloak as payment for the imp job? 
It, ah, is kind of growing on you. Yeah, you… think this might actually work. You’re still looking for some new, quieter clothes and were serious about maybe getting a book to read, if that’s a thing she could throw in or-
“Throwing in” isn’t her style, she says. Go for the “or”.
Or barter for. Right.
Well, she’s got a nice, low-key outfit in what looks to be your size. Anything else you’re looking for – assuming it’s not a mirror – she could probably scrounge up. For the right price. 
You do have some things to sell, you say. At the very least, you want to get some basic, ah, danger escaping supplies. Like a center punch.
… Did you just change in front of me, the shopkeeper asks.
Yes, you admit. But it was like… really fast, so it wasn’t weird, right?
No, she says, it was still weird. 

Huh? Your arms are right here. They were just hidden behind your cloak, it’s not like they disappeared.

Anyway, you’re on a time limit here, so you tell the shopkeeper you’d like to get this finished up as soon as possible. You have a few things that might interest her, and should hopefully be enough to pay for the clothes and get you outfitted with some basic supplies.
Right, she says. It’s late, she’s tired, and she wants to get you out of here too. Let’s see what you’ve got.
First up: these lovely dead imp parts! You took everything that looked like it could be kind of useful. You figure maybe someone could use the intestiney-bits to make a pair of socks, or sausages, or-
Okay, no, the shopkeeper interrupts. She appreciates the whole “making a good sale” thing, but you’re laying it on kind of thick. Also, if she wanted imp intestines, she’s pretty sure she has an entire storeroom plastered in them.
The green bits, though, they should fetch a decent price with alchemists. How does nine septims sound?
Hey, you shrug, that’s more than any bloody organ dug out of your own body is worth.
Actually, she says, Khajiit hearts retail with alchemists for around fifteen gold.
Wow, that’s… you could’ve comfortably gone your whole life without knowing that.

Not unless she’s in the market for a scrap of bread or a tiny pouch of chopped cilantro.

Wait, you say. I, ah… I have something else.
Just hypothetically, what could I get for this?
Less, now that you’ve broken the clasp, she says.
It’s a drama clasp! You just pull on it real fast and it clicks open. I used to have some outfits that… nevermind.
The amulet is enchanted, you explain.
It tastes more like it’s cursed, she says. I think that’s… silence?
Well, yeah, it’s… you guess it’s kind of cursed too.
The Mages Guild gave it to you back when you first learned you had powers. Destruction magic is apparently driven by strong emotions or something, and any time you felt hurt, or dehumanized, your magic would start to trigger whether you wanted it to or not. The amulet of silence was how you kept it reined in.
You guess those are still the same sort of feelings you draw on when you use your magic, but… you think you’ve gotten better at feeling them on your own terms. I mean, lately you’ve been able to whip up some fire-feelings pretty much whenever you need them. And, you guess more importantly, you’re no longer breaking down in tears over every little joke that reminds you that you’ll… never be something you can see as a person.
It’s weird to admit, but you think you might actually have this under control – at least as much as the amulet did. And, on top of that, you think you need to show yourself you have it under control. If you’re gonna be a real wizard, it’s time you take off the dorky safety-hat and start acting like one.
Safety hat. You mean helmet, she asks?
No, I mean like those little… okay, yeah, I guess those are still called helmets. Huh.
Well, either way, she’s afraid it’s standard policy is to turn down ordinary cursed items – even ones with potential uses. It’s probably for the best, though. It sounds like this is something with sentimental value to you and she wouldn’t want to-

The shopkeeper says the nightwriting edition should probably cost a preposterous amount extra, but at five years without a buyer she might as well do the standard price. Five septims.
You’ll take it. Also, you really need something to drink.

You place the ash yam on the pedestal. Despite weight being restored to the pressure plate, the cage does not retract back up. You aren’t actually sure why you expected it to, but that was pretty much your best idea and its failure increments your panic level by about 10%. 
First off, you’re not a cat. Second, flexibility only helps you bend. When it comes to fitting through tight spaces, all that matters are the thickest parts of your body. Which is to say, your head, hips and chest. 
Well okay, really it’s more just your head and hips.
It’s your head.
Still not panicking! However, thinking about how justified it would be to panic right now pushes you a little closer toward full-on panic. It’s probably better to focus on solutions.
You take a look at the-
Whoops, hold on.
You stretch your arms and hold the red orb far away from you, squinting at it as best you can. From what you can tell, it’s just a bowling ball. It has three holes, no ominously-swirling auras inside, and weighs exactly as much as a bowling ball. It apparently had only two jobs: look important, and weigh down a pressure plate until some idiot decided to take it.
In your defense, you didn’t expect there to be a baited trap in an otherwise-empty locked room inside a locked building. If this whole room is part of an elaborate trap, it probably means the incriminating-looking chained door was even more bait, and this entire thing was designed specifically to catch people like you who wanted to take Sigrid down. 
So much for any hope of hiding your intentions. You can’t even remember if you checked the second floor before grabbing the rusty key and careening down here.
Mr.Pineapple wrote: Katia: Levitate the cage and slip away. Gamble wrote: Examine cage, is it resistant to magic?
Thankfully, the cage seems to be made of regular steel, meaning it doesn’t block your magic the way living things or silver seem to. Less thankfully, a steel cage still weighs hundreds and hundreds of pounds. 
You have no problem altering the gravity on a couple bars, panels or rivets, but you can’t seem to get a magical grip on the entire cage – or lift it with the parts you can control. At most, you’re reducing its weight by a two-digit number, and even that may be giving your telekinesis a little too much credit. 
Somehow, coming face-to-face with the ineffectiveness of your skills is building your panic more than being stuck in the cage.

Chewing up a single alchemical ingredient outside of a properly-mixed potion isn’t going to give you super intelligence, even if the book said they were used in that kind of potion. Best case scenario, tediously grinding the entire yam to a fine pulp with your very non-grinding Khajiit teeth will make you a tiny bit smarter for a couple minutes, and then it’ll be gone. 
But… you’re running out of options, and you need to get out of here before Sigrid finds you or the invisibility wears off. Maybe a little extra intelligence is what you need?
You don’t feel any different, but you aren’t sure what a minute gain of intelligence even feels like. 
Alright, think. You need an idea. Some brilliant, intelligent idea that can get you out of here.
You are going to die in a cage.

Okay, on the bright side, funneling all your panic into an attempt to bend the bars seems to have burned the panic down to a manageable level. On a less-bright side, it also seems to have done nothing to the bars, which remain as unbent as ever. 
You turn your attention back to escaping. Not to panic, but between the cloak’s blindness curse and the looming possibility of Sigrid waking up and finding you, you’re on more than one time limit right now. It’s basically a race at this point to see what will fuck you over first.

As best you can tell, there isn’t any sort of chain or rope attached to the top of the cage. The whole thing must have either been hidden in a ceiling compartment hundreds of feet above, or floating directly above the pillar while invisible. 
Given that you’re in a Mages Guild, the convoluted “it was magic” solution somehow seems more likely than the feat of engineering the alternative would take.

Like you suspected, it’s a soul gem and some burnt-out rune-type things. You know what magic enchantments are enough to understand that the gem was keeping a spell maintained, but not enough to know how it actually works, if the spell can be restored, or even if there’s any energy left in the gem. 
Heck, you’re not sure if restoring the spell would even lift the cage back up. It might be designed to levitate the cage, or it might be designed to hold something in place twenty feet above you. Even interpreting something like this is way over your level, let alone getting it to actually function. 
Without any other real options, you take a look at the crates by the wall. You swear, next time you’re gonna look at all the insignificant background details before touching the clearly-important thing. 
Although the crates themselves are too heavy to draw to the cage, you have no problem opening them and looking inside. Some of this stuff looks rather expensive; you find dozens of little glass alchemy-mixing things, dozens of identical robes… someone could equip and train entire classrooms full of mages with this stuff, were it not packed away down in this oubliette. 
Oh, hey, daggers!
Alright, they’re silver daggers. That little nuance of magic is never going to stop pissing you off.

It’s not a bag, it’s a rolled up pelt. As for what’s inside, it looks like it contains… the rest of the pelt, all rolled up. The leather straps around it look rather sturdy, however; you might be able to bend the cage bars if you wrap them around a pair and twist. 
Or at least, you could see that working for bars that aren’t an inch thick and made of solid steel.
The remaining two chests seem to be locked, and are too heavy to pull. This box, though, contains a set of paints.

Or she might come down while the cloak’s recharging, which would leave you blind, completely visible, and at her mercy with no chance of escape or fighting back. As long as you can get these bars apart and escape before the cloak runs dry, you’ll be fine. Or heck, even if you only manage to get out of the cage, you can hide in a barrel or behind that wall while it recharges. 
If you were going to try to recharge the cloak, you really should’ve started it as soon as you were trapped. The way you see it, the chances of Sigrid coming down and checking the trap get higher with every second, so losing a big chunk of time while blind is not going to be your advantage if you want to get out of here before-
You hear a latch click echo through the cavern.

Sigrid lets out a wistful sigh. Oh, how I wish I were so lucky! But no, I’m wearing eighty thousand septims worth of spells and enchantments right now, all for the same covetable magic absorption you received through fortuitous star alignments at birth. 
Then again, it’s a little funny if you think about it. There you are, with a gift of literally divine origin, and yet someone like me can just buy the same thing. Starsigns, pyrokinetic powers, and even invisibility all seem a little passé when someone with the right equipment can just-

Again, Sigrid emphasizes, she can see when you’re getting ready to throw something. And you do know that had a sheath on it, right?
You admit the sheath thing occurred to you pretty much right when it was leaving your hand, yes. You don’t exactly operate well in stressful situations, and being trapped in a secret spiraling death-oubliette by a creepy mind-controlling evil sorceress kind of qualifies as one. 
“Evil sorceress”? Katia Managan, your words wound me more than any dagger through the heart! I assure you, I’m no evil sorceress here to cause you harm. I have only your best interests in mind, along with mine and everyone else’s. 
Since I happen to have you over, though, I just want to talk. Find out where we got off on the wrong foot, and see if we can put things back to how they should be. 
Just you and me. Heart to heart. Woman to woman.
I’ll even unsummon the tumblespider, if he’s making you uncomfortable. They like to stop bouncing and listen when there’s talking. 
bob wrote: spill the guts on her Spyder wrote: Her mind control powers are scent based. Block your nose with cilantro!
You don’t have those things anymore! You used them while breaking in. Right now, your inventory is mostly clothes, keys, and books – nothing that will help you in a tight situation. 
The bread you picked up contains the necessary alchemical reagents to let you temporarily see invisible things, and the tacks and ball you threw are still within reach, but Sigrid is going to see anything you try. She’s probably already getting suspicious, since you’re standing here thinking instead of replying to her. 
You’ve, ah…
You’ve actually been imagining a timer up there for a while. You’d rather ignore it, though, since you kind of have enough to panic about right now. 

Well gee, it was supposed to be until the cloak wears off, but now you’re pretty worried it might also mark the end of your life. At least right now, you can still try to dodge anything Sigrid throws at you, or at the very least see what she’s doing. Once the cloak takes your eyesight, all you’ll have to defend yourself is your words.
But maybe that’s not so bad. Maybe… you can just talk your way out of this?

Look, you tell Sigrid, I’m sorry I broke into your secret death cave. I was looking for my stuff, but all the doors in the Guild were locked, and then I found a key to that one that was all chained up, so I thought… My point is, bad decisions were made. I just want to get that package you stole from me last night, and I promise I’ll be out of your hair forever.
Sigrid’s brow furrows with concern. Katia, you’re speaking almost as if I robbed you! As I remember things, it was you who you generously elected to donate some supplies to my guildhall – and I was greatly appreciative of your contribution, no matter how meager. Yet, for some reason you’re now in here trying to steal it back, all while accusing me of theft!
“Generously elected to donate”? You mind controlled me! You put on your weird pheromone perfume, and it made me think you were the greatest thing ever!
If my perfume made you think more highly of me, Miss Managan, then I daresay it accomplished exactly what perfume is supposed to do. Why, if you’re going to penalize me for being likable, I’m almost offended that you’d attribute it solely to some silly perfume rather than my good looks or winning charm! 
But you see, what I truly find concerning is how your perception of me could’ve shifted so suddenly and without warning. In nary a day, I feel like I’ve gone from your close friend to a bitter enemy. 
Well yeah, my perception of you kinda tanked when I realized you mind controlled me!
Sigrid’s voice takes on a feigned tone of remorse. I am deeply sorry if I somehow made you feel this way, Katia, and for all the distress it has clearly caused you. If I may ask, were these perceptions triggered by something I said? Something you thought about after we parted ways? Maybe even something you ate or drank, after which you suddenly found yourself thinking-
Wait…
This isn’t some kind of gloaty villain speech. 
You’re trying to figure out how I threw off your control.
And you’re still speaking as though I am some sort of monster out to do you harm. 
What I’m interested in, Katia, is simply constructive criticism. For you to say these horrible things about me, break into my home, and go snooping into my perfectly inconspicuous storage rooms implies to me that I clearly wasn’t the friend to you I thought I was. If I’m to avoid these situations in the future, I need to know exactly what caused these negative feelings to emerge. With the number of friends I have, you’re certainly not the first I’ve had quibbles like this with, but I’m a quick learner. I’ve become much more careful when choosing my words and accessories, enough that I can usually keep this sort of situation from happening… or lasting. 
Everyone I know is happy to be my friend, and I enjoy being their friend in turn. Is it truly so wrong to care about others’ happiness, Katia? Because if you think so, maybe you’re–
Holy shit, Sigrid, you’re an evil mind control wizard! You can’t turn that around and make me the bad guy here!
Nobody is a “bad guy” here, Miss Managan! We’re simply two people discussing our problems. And the sooner we figure out where things went wrong – what would drive you to steal back the donations you made to your favorite guildhall – the sooner we can carry on as if none of this ever happened. 
If you don’t mind my saying, you’re not the most intimidating person I’ve had in that cage. Stephane, for one, knew a distressing battery of combat magic – and that was before I started wearing the absorption spells. I am confident that with the right words we can come to a peaceful solution that we are both happy with. 
And I should remind you, it’s not as if you have any other choice.


You could understand that logic if you had been the one insisting there’s no other choice, but most people aren’t automatically wrong about everything. As much as you hate to admit it, this situation really is feeling more hopeless by the second.
Of course, you’re not gonna let Sigrid know that. You’re going to be an obstinate dickbag and keep trying to escape, just to spite her.

So you wanna know how I broke through your evil jerkface mind control? Why don’t you ask some of the other people in town who did it? You know about all of them, right?
Let me guess, Sigrid says: you’re talking about Stephane? He didn’t “break through my control”, as you so dramatically phrased it. 
Except he totally did! He was the one who told me all about the bug musk and enchantments, and he even helped me plan this burglary, just to take your ego down a peg! 
And again, let me guess: this was justified with some spiel about me being a magical hero chosen by the gods?
… after some additional consideration, you admit to Sigrid that Stephane may have not broken her control. But, what then? You mind-controlled him into believing a bunch of fairytales so he’d like you, and then help lure people into your dumb trap?
First off, this trap isn’t dumb, it’s fantastic. Thieves always go for an ominous altar, and I think we can both agree that the big cage is more artful than a cheap paralysis rune. 
Second, I never mind-controlled your dear friend into believing anything. He happened to have an affinity for old heroic lore, and once we got talking and I discovered this, I found a way we could bond over it and coexist on better terms. That’s just what people do. And, yes, I had to wear some extra-nice perfume to get him to even sit down and civilly talk to me at first, but I’m hardly a villain for wanting to open a dialogue. If anything, sharing his interests with genuine enthusiasm is simply being a good friend. 
And just look where that gets people! Did our mutual friend even mention this trap to you? I’m half-willing to bet he’s so ashamed about his behavior in our initial meeting that he’s willed himself into forgetting the embarrassing little details.
Oh my fucking gods, you erased his memories?
Sigrid sighs. I didn’t do anything, Miss Managan. There you go again, spinning me as some sort of evil mastermind for things other people–
–did because your creepy alchemy made them love you! Like why the fuck do you think you should get to control what everyone thinks?
Honestly, Katia?
Because people suck.
… what?
Because people are terrible. Do I really have to spell it out? As much as you all love to talk about right and wrong, every person seems to have their own idea of what that is, and – surprise surprise – it’s always whatever feeds their desires. The clergyman wants more people reading his fanfiction, the shopkeeper wants there to be lower taxes, and the little khajiiti wizard wants everyone to treat her like she matters. The “evil” these people decry is whatever happens to be inconveniencing them at that moment, and the “good” they praise is whatever licks their shiny boots. They’re animals, Katia. Selfish, short-sighted animals, and–
–And what, you think you’re somehow any better than everyone else?
No, Katia, that’s the thing. I’m not better than them. I’m better at it than them. 
Deep down, I’m just as awful and conceited as everyone else. The things I want aren’t fair to everyone, I cause problems for people I don’t care about, and I do it all while fully convinced that I’m right about everything. Is that what you want? An admission of human fallibility? Because I’m no moral paragon. I’m just quite good at getting what I want.
I didn’t decide the unfair way the world works. I’m just exceptionally good at working within it. When it comes down to it, what you hate me for is competence – the fact that in a world full of self-serving animals, I’m the one doing it best. It’s jealousy, really. You wish you had the power I did, and if our roles were switched, I guarantee you’d have someone in this cage calling you a–
–I wouldn’t have a cage! Like, I’d take this big empty ritual chamber and turn it into an indoor pool with a crystal-themed juice bar or something! The fact that two thirds of your house are dedicated to a giant trap is a sign that you are a crazy, evil person who shouldn’t be controlling what people think! 
And just what are good and evil here, Katia? Would I be good for letting people follow their every short-sighted desire, even at the expense of others? Or if I were as apathetic toward the world as the gods that created it? You, of everyone, should understand that someone left to their own devices doesn’t always get what they want. Maybe things would be different for you if you had a friend who was willing to be more involved, perhaps able to get you to listen to them. 
Well gee, fuck you too, Sigrid. Maybe the reason I could resist your control is because I’m so goddamn resistant to good advice. 
We can work on that. Together, I think we can find a good, reliable way to get my helpful advice through to you, just like everyone else, leaving no animosity and distrust between us. 
Machofish wrote: Can you ask Sigrid to drop the condescending “I’m really your friend!” act?
You’re alone, it’s not like she’s playing to an audience, it’s clear you’re not buying her act.
Let’s put it this way – it takes more than cat-like flexibility for someone to shove their head that far up their own ass. Jeff wrote: I am beginning to think that she isn’t even joking, and is just crazy enough to think that her actions are justified.
You open your mouth to speak, but hesitate. 
This isn’t an act. At this point, it’s starting to look pretty clear that Sigrid is just completely insane. She’s not going to let you out of this cage until she’s thoroughly interrogated you on how you broke her mind control, and then it sounds like she’s just going to send you away with some kind of mind control you can’t break. And probably robbed, since you’re wearing a 200 septim cloak and she’s a jerk. 
But, she also loves to talk. Assuming she doesn’t get tired of your antics and drop a rock on you, you might be able to stall her long enough to come up with an escape plan. Maybe you can find a loose bar on the cage, or rip up her enchanted clothes if she gets too close, or…
Or maybe if magic is so dependant on emotions try to connect your current anger and hurt with the one you felt when you were mind controlled to get outside of the mages guild.
… or maybe there’s a magical solution. She may be resistant to your fireballs and apathetic toward your telekinesis, but you’re still a wizard, capable of manipulating magicka. If you can find some way to get yourself past the bars, or to negate Sigrid’s resistance spells, or even to get a message outside, you might have a shot at escaping. It’s like that saying, “desperation is the mother of”… learning, you think it was? You’re pretty sure you got it wrong. 
What you mean is that you’re out of ideas so you need to buy time while you frantically figure out how to pull off some incredibly complex magic, or else you’re fucked.

Only thing I can think of, since she can see you through that cloak anyway, is to take it off and try to talk with her while focusing on listening and talking your way out. Preferable to start the recharge countdown now if you think you’ll be here for more than 15 minutes than add an additional 75 minutes to your “ability to see” timer by waiting now. I think. There’s nothing around here that can help you right now, and the only way you are getting out of here is if she lets you at this point. 
And if you’re just going to be talking and thinking…
You tell Sigrid alright. If you’re going to explain how you broke through her mind control, you need to share some context. While it might sound longwinded and arbitrary, you assure her that everything you are about to say is incredibly important. The first thing you have to tell her is the story of the, ah… littlest… dog. 
You hope this isn’t suspicious. 

 
You take a deep breath and clear your mind. Every good story needs a dramatic pause after the title drop. You take the moment to assess the situation. 
You already used your telekinesis a few times while the cloak was recharging, so you know blindness doesn’t inhibit your ability to…
Well, it’s not really the same as seeing. It’s more like… sensing the implication of something. Like how you can tell people have a skeleton inside them, even though you only see it through how they move. You doubt that you could have noticed this magical aspect of things while blind, but now that you know that it’s there, it’s easy enough to discern. It’s like listening for your name in a noisy room. 
Magically-speaking, your own presence is loud and clear, linked with what you assume is the Cloak of Gray Tomorrow. The stone platform, the pillar, and a couple of the cage bars are vaguely readable, but without your eyesight as a guide, it’s trickier to get a sense of exactly where they are relative to you. Sigrid’s little daedra stands out much more than they do, and you can sense a strand of magicka connecting him to…
OH GODS 
YOUR EYES
Out of force of habit, you toggle your darkvision, which you’re pretty sure just makes the illusory light even brighter. You hope eye-blood doesn’t show through your mask. 
Luckily, you manage to coolly segue your pained flailing into a dramatic glance over your shoulder. At least, you’re choosing to believe it looked cool. 
Aaaanyway, you tell Sigrid, let me tell you the story of the littlest dog.

Once upon a time in Hammerfell, there was a very small dog. He was a golden retriever named Pokey, coppery beige in color, with droopy ears, bouncy fur, and a thick leather collar. Through happenstance, we came to meet one day when I was little. Nobody knew who owned him, but we quickly became the best of friends.
Honestly, the littlest dog was my only friend growing up. I taught him how to fetch sticks, how to dig holes, and I would strap toy swords all over him so we could go on adventures. We were inseparable.
As time went on, though, the littlest dog started getting into trouble more and more often. Even though he was always ashamed when reprimanded, he just wasn’t good at being a good dog. One day, he just decided to leave Hammerfell. According to some people, he started responding to the name “Lulu” instead, and wandered off toward the heartland…
Huh, you’re already starting to struggle with the story a little. Maybe trying to base it off your own life wasn’t such a good idea. When you cut out all the sex and alcohol, your life story is pretty much “you were in Hammerfell and then now you are here”. 
You could’ve planned this distraction out better.
Dawnfeathers wrote: Request some refreshments Tmcool wrote: Ask for a drink since you’ll get pretty parched. It’ll also stall for time so you can think of a story and see again 
You pause and explain to Sigrid that telling a story this long is a lot of work, especially after you’ve been running around town all night. Your throat is kind of parched. 
There’s a barrel of water right here, Sigrid says. She asks if you have any objections to using an alchemical mortar as a cup. 
Water is a little plain, you say. What you’re really in the mood for is some coffee. Like, not black coffee. Something with a lot of cream and sugar, if she has that upstairs. And could maybe go get it.
Sigrid says you’re kind of milking this request. Also, possibly trying to get rid of her. 
No, you explain, you just need very specific things in order to tell this very important story adequately. But fine, if she’s not going to get you what you need, you’ll just stand here in silence and swallow saliva for two minutes until you’re not thirsty anymore. You tell her she brought this upon herself. 
Try re-creating the properties you see on Tumblespider; perhaps if you can copy the one dictating that Tumblespider is a monster summoned into this world, you will summon your own.
If that kind of magic is possible, you suspect it’s way over your level. The “properties” you see on things aren’t concrete entities: they disappear and reappear from moment to moment, and they never look quite the same twice. Trying to build something like that out of rudimentary magicka-pushing would probably be like trying to build a living creature out of food. The best you’d get is one of those animal-shaped chicken nuggets they give to kids.
On top of that, you still haven’t been able to modify the properties of anything alive. It’s just like silver: even when you tried to levitate yourself, the most you could do was lift up your clothing. If you’re trying to directly alter the properties of something, you’d probably have better luck messing with one of the cage bars. 
There were a few symbols that seemed like they might represent tangibility. Looking into them could be a start.
Or… destruction magic, on the other hand, might be a simpler solution. None of your earlier experiments with conjuring ice and lightning worked out, but if you could find the trigger for frost magic, it probably wouldn’t be hard to weaken and kick out a bar. Plus, depending how the bar breaks, you might be left with a viable weapon. Hopefully not in your leg. 
Of course, Sigrid would have ample warning of what’s happening if she saw you heating and cooling a bar. Plus, destruction spells eat through your magicka reserve dangerously fast, and you have no idea how much you have left. Plus, fighting someone in hand-to-hand combat isn’t going to be easy when all you can see is the general direction they are standing. 
Running away on foot isn’t an option, either – at least not until your sight comes back. It was hard enough making it down that twisty path when you could see.
And it’s time to build a shovel.
Focus on the magic around you, feel it’s flow. How it moves, what it does. You don’t need eyes. You can see what gives everything it’s properties. What makes everything what it is. Remember, you lifted a peg with an Amulet of Silence on. You aren’t wearing that anymore. You can do far more than lift objects and move them with your eyes. Not only can you alter the laws of the things around you. Your unicorns, which is to say your magic, can now leave your body with a rider. There is no bridge blocking its path.
Take that energy, guide it out of your body. Ride your magic outside of the cage and out of the cave you are in. Take it through the trap door and into the room you came from. Make a tunnel out of magic to out of here and somewhere safe.
Now, take each of the attributes that make you who you are. Your senses, your body, your mind. Steadily push them through the tunnel until they reach the other side. Do not lose yourself. Feel yourself sliding through the magical passage you created. Making your way to the other side should be as simple as climbing out of a bedroll. 
Congratulations, Managan. You can teleport.
Wow, okay, that sounds like a solution you can work with.
You concentrate on your own energy, carefully guiding a strand of it out of the cage, through the ambient magicka, and toward the basement door. 
Almost immediately, however, you run into a problem: once you get more than a few feet from your body, the ambient magicka fades into a black abyss. Sigrid still stands out like a sore thumb, and you could sense the tumblespider up until it stepped away from the cage, but without your sight it’s surprisingly hard to focus on inanimate objects you can’t reach. 
You’re guessing it must be a factor of magical power. Sigrid and her enchantments are very strong, so you can pinpoint her all the way on the other side of the dais. The tumblespider is likely just an animal from another plane, so a short distance is all it needs to escape your detection. But things like the basement door are completely undetectable, as are the people up on the surface – even though some of the priests in town had considerable magic skills. 
As you reach further, though, you start to notice something unnerving.
There are things you can detect even further away.

 




Katia?
Miss Managan?
I’d hate to think you were ignoring me, Katia, especially-
Ack, right! The story!
I’m here! I’m here, you say, shaking confusing images from your head. Sorry, I just got… where did I leave off again? Sigrid explains that you were telling a story about a dog named Lulu, claiming it to be important. Right, you say. You’re gonna keep telling that, now. 
You’re a little dizzy. You hear footsteps and an ominous shuffling sound, like Sigrid is adjusting her clothes or pulling something out of them. Without your sight, though, you can’t tell exactly what she’s doing.
Unlike everyone else, the little girl was willing to try to play with him. First, she tried to play fetch. She threw a stick. But on the way to get the stick, he saw a nice juicy steak on the side of the road. Distracted, he went towards the steak, and accidentally stepped on the stick and broke it. “At least I could still bring back the steak”, he thought, but as he turned to look at the stick he broke, a bird came down and took the steak. Now he had no steak, and no stick. But he still decided to bring back the broken stick to the girl. And, amazingly enough, the girl was willing to give him one more chance.
She would throw him another stick. A bigger, sturdier stick. But this time, she would throw it very far. And if he can bring it back this time, she’ll take him as her dog.
Clearing your throat, you delve back into the distraction.
Aaaanyway the littlest dog wanted to become a good dog, so he went to a far away place to get away from his bad habits, but since everyone in the distant land just saw him as a stray dog, he got in the same type of trouble all over again, until one day, he ran across a little girl who was willing to play with him a little.
First she tried to play fetch with him, but he got distracted by a freshly-cooked steak that was on the side of the road. Only when he started for the steak, he stepped on the stick and ruined it. And then birds ate it. The steak, I mean, not the stick. The ah… 
It’s hard! You talk fast when you’re nervous.
Still talking too fast, you tell Sigrid that the story is actually quite complex, which is why it’s so hard to remember all the important pieces when telling it on the spot. It’s a well-loved classic back where you grew up, though, and the more educated scholars of the land can easily spend ten minutes analyzing the subtleties and meanings of the symbolism of the first part alone. 
I thought it was a personal story, Sigrid says. You were literally a character in it. 
You weren’t a character in it, you explain, the story is just told from the first person perspective. It’s part of the symbolism, but you can understand if she missed it. You did at first too. Only the smartest people can listen to half the story and then spend ten minutes picking out all the deep meaning in it. 
Katia, she asks, are you clumsily asking me to analyze your story back to you? No, you quickly say, you’re just expressing that she probably can’t spend as long doing it as the really smart people can. Sigrid sighs, and says the story isn’t that complicated.  First of all, you’re from Hammerfell, so the idea of escaping past predilections by relocating is obvious. Secondly, words words words with all the rumors that have been words words words words words about a Khajiit words words words words words words words words words havoc words words words words words words words words words words words words words words words words words words words
words words words words havoc words words words words words words words words words words words words words words…
With Sigrid temporarily preoccupied, you quickly check the countdown timer on your blindness (41 minutes remaining) and open your inventory. 
A vast majority of your equipment is completely useless for escaping an evil sorceress while blind. You have several keys to doors you’ve already gone through, six magic books you briefly flipped through but now cannot read, a book for blind alchemists you could read but have already read, and a lockpick with nothing to unlock. 
As far as magical items go, you are in possession of one (1) possibly-filled soul gem and one (1) cursed invisibility cloak that currently has a blindness spell on you. Alchemically-speaking, you have a cotton bandage you might be able to eat as a very temporary magic resistance potion, and a scrap of bread you may be able to siphon a very temporary vision spell out of. As a naturally magic-resistant person who can see magic, these are not very useful potions to have. 
You also have a neck gaiter, currently pulled up over your face, and two sheets of mostly-used paper.

While you can definitely “see” the magicka circuit that is keeping you blinded, any effort to change it is like prying a steel bar with your bare hands. You still aren’t completely sure how this stuff works, or if your confusing blue squiggles are even an accurate visualization of it, but whatever force keeps you from altering the magic of living things seems to be protecting the blindness spell as well. 
As for that other symbol you keep seeing, you doubt it’s unluckiness, since you’ve noticed it even on inanimate things. From the looks of it, you’re guessing it has to do with wilting, or… decay? 
This is probably what wizards mess with to extend their lifespan. Any time but now, the secret to immortality would’ve been a pretty cool discovery.
You’re no skyentist, but you’re pretty sure you were sensing stars. Lots and lots and lots of faraway stars, swirling all over. 
Even though the stars’ magic was apparently strong enough to sense all the way from this cage, it didn’t seem to have any of the usual blue squiggles and circles. It was more like they were just… beacons, of pure magic. Or at least, you’re assuming that’s what it means when something comes across as a plain white dot. You’re making a lot of guesses and assumptions here based on a very vague understanding of sorcery. 
While, again, you’re not an expert, you’re pretty sure people can’t just pull stars out of the sky. If they could, you are 100% certain all the stars would be gone by now, and probably owned by khajiit.
But… now that you think about it, there is magic that involves pulling creatures and tools from other worlds. It can’t be too complicated, either; you’ve seen Sigrid casually summon weird animals several times now, and to your knowledge she’s no summoning expert. If your magic can sense the stars all the way out at the edges of Oblivion, maybe it’s fully within your power to reach out to something near them. 
Of course, even if you manage to reach out among the stars and find a weapon or something, you aren’t sure about how to get it from there to here. Maybe that part comes naturally after you reach something? Or if it doesn’t, maybe you can still relay a message to the outside.
Or maybe your careless tampering with otherworldly forces will accidentally summon a fiery hell-demon that wants to kill everyone. That seems to happen in a lot of cautionary tales about tampering with otherworldly forces. But like… as long as the demon ends up on the other side of the cage bars, you’re pretty sure that would still be a win.
As far as you can hear, the cave is empty other than Sigrid’s voice and an occasional rustling you assume is the tumblespider. A little over a minute has passed since she started talking about how the story is just a thin metaphor for your life, and you aren’t sure how much longer this cheap trick is going to buy you. Doing your best to think magic thoughts and sense magic energy, you once again reach out as far as you can…

 Another minute has passed. Sigrid is still talking, for now.

 You're pretty sure at least another minute has passed, maybe two. You're losing track.

 Maybe otherworldly forces just really don't want to help you. Or, maybe beckoning help from otherworldly forces is just completely outside the abilities of a stupid country bumpkin who started magic two days ago. Like, it wouldn't exactly be the first time you've grossly overestimated your capabilities. It wouldn't be the first time in the last five minutes, what with your plan to magically teleport out of here.

 Or... maybe you're not looking in the right spot.
 You've been weaving your little magicka-line around in the distance as though you're going to find another world far, far away. If summoning creatures from other planes was some kind of very-long-range teleport, though, then every summoner would have to be an expert at teleportation. And like, you've seen Sigrid walk places. If you could teleport, you would never, ever walk. 
 But maybe it's not a distance thing, but "another sheet of paper". If you were actually going to invoke some kind of otherworldly help, maybe you have to look in some kind of weird, fuckways direction.
 Which, of course, puts you back at square one. And to make matters worse, you hear a finality in Sigrid's tone that implies she's nearing the end of her longwinded explanation. Without the slightest lead, your plan to come up with a plan isn't exactly going great right now.

Katia: Greet friend




Yeah, that’s… that’s just called moving in three dimensions. It’s not exactly a witchhunter-tier accomplishment. You’ve actually been doing it a lot out here, you just don’t have a second mind’s eye for depth perception.
The entire point of the “separate sheet of paper” analogy was that each “sheet” represented a whole three-dimensional universe. If you’re right, it doesn’t matter how far inward, outward, up, down, left or right you reach your little magicka line – you’d never reach across into the “next sheet” because it’s not in any of those directions. Rather than literally being on top of eachother like a stack of paper, the planes people summon help from would be lined up in some fourth dimension. And unlike a needle poking through papers, you can’t imagine what something reaching perpendicularly through multiple universes would even look like.


Unless…
You think back to that thing you were always told, about the stars being “holes to Aetherius”. If the night sky were a giant black ceiling like you thought when you were little, then a hole poked through it would just be a circle. But… if someone cut a round hole in three dimensional space, it wouldn’t be a circle – it would be a sphere. A sphere-shaped hole leading directly in the fourth dimension!
Of course, when you tried to slam your little magicka-line into the stars, it just bounced off the edges. This could mean the “holes to Aetherius” story is bullshit and you’re overthinking a children’s fairytale, or it could just mean that the hole is closed off on its edges. Given that you can move your magicka-line freely around the outside of the star, that really makes it less of a “hole” and more of a “tube”. And if the star is just a cross-section of a weird tube leading across multiple planes, maybe you could…


Fuck, that’s right, the book! Just before you went blind, you were looking at a magic book that mentioned otherworldly denizens, and there was a whole section in it talking about stars! You frantically try to recall details of what you saw. If your ridiculous and over-complicated idea about stars being tubes reaching through multiple planes of existence is right, you might be able to follow those tubes. If you knew roughly where the next step along a four-dimensional tube was going to be, following it might be as simple as, like, searching the correct spot in three-dimensional space. You remember the book had an almost map-like diagram of some constellations with six stars labeled, and if you could remember what…

Well, you’re definitely seeing something. And unlike the vague magic shapes you’ve been sensing up until now, you actually are seeing something. You’re just not sure what it is.
Reaching your magic through the sky until you see skeletons should probably make you uneasy, but for some reason, it just… doesn’t. In fact, you feel almost happy, like an old friend just came through the door and you want to give them a hug. You feel blessed that this friend chose to summon with CairnCorp®, and are wondering how you can best serve them today. 
You quietly ask the skeleton if it can hear you.
What was that, Sigrid asks?
While she speaks, you take note that you can hear yourself loud and clear, even in the noisy Chapel of the Arts™ auditorium. Which is weird, because you were never wondering if you could hear yourself, nor are you in an auditorium. If there’s interference with the connection, you realize, you could always nullify the tesseract and reestablish the leyline through a static magetallow array. You don’t know what any of these things mean or why you are thinking them. These… aren’t your thoughts.
Can you repeat that, Sigrid asks again, with the slightest note of frustration.
I was, ah, just wondering if you could hear me, you say, pushing the intrusive thoughts to the back of your mind. You lie and tell Sigrid that you’ve been very quietly responding to all the stuff she’s been saying for the last ten minutes, but it might have been too quiet for her to hear. 
You can feel the foreign thoughts wondering if you’re still there, or if the liminal connection has degraded. Hold on, you think to yourself, struggling to untangle your own thoughts and senses from these new ones. 
As an introduction, you quickly think about yourself: an amateur mage in a desperate situation, hoping to maybe reach out to some otherworldly help. You know that’s a thing lots of mages do, summoning animals and weapons from other worlds. Ideally, you’d prefer help from a neutral entity rather than some kind of evil demon god. You retroactively realize that might be offensive if the skeleton is an evil demon god. You think about how potentially sorry you are for thinking that.
Luckily, the skeleton’s positive feelings only grow stronger. It realizes that you’ve connected to the perfect plane! CairnCorp® is a privately-owned corporation providing a safe†, approachable alternative to daedric summoning. The glorious Makers® believe that conjuration doesn’t have to be about whisking unexpecting beasts away from their home plane – it can be a friendly business, building strong customer relationships and offering exciting paid upgrade plans‡. “Summoning with a smile, not a scowl”, we are willed to say.

I strive to be an accommodating person, Katia. I think everyone should do what they can to get along with others, and a big part of that is letting them take the lead so you can both discover where your shared interests lie. 
But let’s be honest: friendship isn’t your forte. In fact, sometimes, it’s like you don’t want to connect with others. Right now, it feels almost like you’re trying to waste my time for the crime of wanting you to like me. 
I don’t think you’re a bad person, Katia, but it hurts that you could come to hate me so quickly without even sharing how the feelings arose. Put simply, I fear I may hurt someone else the same way I hurt you, and want to know how to avoid it so I can better hold onto you and my other friends in the future. I want to be better, but it’s like you don’t care and just want to waste my time.
And I think you know that you’re just wasting time.
The skeleton considers CairnCorp®‘s many enticing aid options that you may find beneficial. For general protection, the Makers® in their benevolence offer several convenient models of skeletal minions pre-equipped with armor and weaponry in guaranteed optimal condition‡†. If you’re looking for mystic aid, you can sign a liability waiver for access to the Makers®‘ holiest phantasms and ghasts. If your blindness is a preexisting condition, CairnCorp® even offers the option to reassign any conjuration code to a cute and convenient seeing-eyesocket dog. No matter your need, CairnCorp® is exalted to provide.
Do you really, Katia? Correct me if I’m wrong, but you’re not exactly overwhelmed with people who care for you. You all but said as much when we first met, and were adorably head-over-heels when we clicked. Again, don’t take this wrong, but you could probably spend the next week down here wasting my time with meandering stories and nobody would go wondering where you disappeared to.
There’s an eerie slowness to the final bit, giving it clear emphasis. 
And – while I hate to think it – I worry sometimes that you could just disappear off the face of the world and you’d have no close friends to miss you. That’s not a way anyone should live, Katia. I want to help you. But if I’m going to try to be your friend, you have to at least try to reciprocate. Perhaps care a little more about my interests and problems, and less about yourself?
Something about this still seems distressingly convenient. Like, if summoning perfectly subservient skeleton-people were this easy, everyone would do it. There has to be some catch. But, you’re running out of time here, so whatever the horrible drawback is, you’ll just have to deal with it later. You think you’re ready; please… send help, or whatever they do.
Friendship isn’t about “me”, it’s about “we”. Everything you do, Katia, it’s always so focused on getting things from people, or improving your own standing. But you have to understand, these boons come on their own if you’re simply nice to others and show an interest in their interests. And of everyone you could possibly practice on, my interest is simply making people like you as happy as possible. All you have to do is help me understand how you came to hate me so vehemently. Something you accidentally did managed to nigh-instantly sour you to one of your best friends. 
Look at where you are right now. Or I should say, look metaphorically, what with you pulling Tavia’s old invisibility cloak off like that. All your life, you’ve been doing things your way, thinking only of yourself and not the collective good of everyone around you. And look where it’s gotten you: all alone, without a single friend to help you when you are in trouble.

To your dismay, you only feel confusion in response. “Contract”? The skeleton reminds you that CairnCorp® prides itself on providing a more comfortable‡‡ user experience than the run-of-the-mill daedric plane, and would never trick clients into signing a long and confusing contract. The only contractual agreement in this packet is the first three pages, briefly outlining the basic benefits and user-end liabilities of your free CairnCorp® Conjurer Account™. The bottom of Page 3 is where you agree to these terms, pages 4-6 are where you set up your account preferences, and pages 7-354 are mandatory questions on your demographics and interests to help CairnCorp® notify you of specials and promotions that are just right‡‡† for you.
What, Sigrid says? 
You quickly come to the horrifying realization that a skeletal warrior is not about to pop over into the room, and your clever line was completely mistimed. While you frantically try to figure out what’s going on with the summoning spell, you explain to Sigrid that by “bone to pick” you mean “I will tell you everything you want to know, just please please please don’t do the bug musk thing”. 
The room is silent for a tense moment (at least, you’re pretty sure the music is from the skeleton’s end of the telepathic link). Sigrid sighs once again, but this time doesn’t take a single step.
The skeleton admires your eagerness to conjure with CairnCorp®, but notes that CairnCorp’s success comes from understanding the needs‡‡‡ of their customers, and the registration forms are required for all new accounts. However, the entire page on gender and sexuality is optional, so it’s really only 349 pages that require your input. 
To get you started, the skeleton flips ahead to “Which of the following conditions (magical or otherwise) have you been afflicted with in the last 6 months” and puts a mark by “blindness”. Would you like to add more to this answer, or return to page one?
Okay, you say, but like, I promise this time I am actually going to tell you how I broke through the creepy mind control. You don’t have to use the mind control perfume stuff, because I am going to answer your question now. Any second now.
Katia…
I am! The truth is, after I gave you all my stuff, I started thinking about the very important delivery I was doing for my best friend, and how I gave you her package, and it… it didn’t make sense. And that was it.

The skeleton can understand where the paperwork might be inconvenient. This is why they always encourage prospective users to register before the need arises. If your aggressor is using mind control magic, perhaps you could use a resistance spell or potion to delay them while you set up your account?
You were born magic-resistant (the skeleton marks this under the “conditions” question), and if chewing up an alchemical ingredient for a tiny effect counts as a “potion”, you have a magic resistance potion too. The problem is that she’s not using a magic spell – she’s using some kind of pheromone perfume. You think it was called “Telvanni Bug Musk”? Whatever it was, your magic resistance didn’t seem to help at all. 
The skeleton ponders your predicament. It has never encountered such a situation before, and isn’t sure the best way to proceed. Hold on, I’m going to push this down to Regional.
Wait, what?
It’s not a game! That’s what happened! I thought about the thing I did, and it seemed really dumb, and… I realized it was mind control. 
Sigrid starts to reply, but you cut her off and keep going. Look, you’re right, I’m not good at people. I have like one friend, and I think it might be the latest in a long line of pity friendships. And all that stuff you said about me just trying to advance my own standing, it’s kinda true! Would you like me to explain everything else you’re right about, slowly so that you can savor it?
No, I’d like you to answer my question, Katia, which you are clearly unwilling to-
I did! I answered it! It’s not an exciting answer, but it’s the truth and I don’t have anything else I can give you!
The smallest tinge of anger enters Sigrid’s tone, although it quickly fades. You hear the hollow echo of the ceramic bottle in her hand. Nothing you’ve said has been the truth, Katia. Every word has been stalling and misdirection, and I find it hard to believe you are telling me the whole truth now, especially with an answer so banally empty. But, it’s no matter. With a little help, I’m sure you’ll understand where I’m coming from, and give me the information I want.
The skeleton considers your situation: you need additional time to fill out the registration paperwork, but are in immediate danger of being mind controlled. Yes, they are already equipped for magic resistance, the skeleton thinks. The aggressor is exercising mind control through a pheromone called “Telvanni Bug Musk”. 
The skeleton waits as the Keeper™ ponders your predicament. Just like the skeleton, the Keeper™ has never encountered such a situation. It’s moving this down to Corporate.
The skeleton explains the situation. Listening carefully, the Keeper™ suggests utilizing a magic resistance potion or spell to buy additional time for the paperwork. The skeleton notes that this was tried, but the aggressor is using atypical mind control methods – a pheromone they called “Telvanni Bug Musk”. 
The Keeper™ ponders your predicament. It has never encountered such a situation before, and isn’t sure the best way to proceed. Hold on, I’m going to push this down to Corporate.
Sigrid replies with something about how she’s already been very nice and you’re the one who keeps shooting it down. You have three sets of senses right now and it’s getting kind of super hard to keep track of, but you’re pretty sure she’s saying “no”.
With the meager remainder of your attention you try to call her out as hypocritical, but she confidently replies with something or other about how you’re wrong and she’s right. Despite not hearing the details, you try to explain-
Woah, hold the bone-phone. Did you say Telvanni Bug Musk?
The Keeper™ confirms that the skeleton said you called it Telvanni Bug Musk. The skeleton corroborates. You note that, yes, that is what you remember it being called. 
Flippin’ fibulas, is this conjurer dealing with the damned Telvanni? Which Telvanni is it? If it’s Mistress Dratha, that witch owes me her soul, twice! Unless she’s somehow grown a second soul in the last 2500 years, I’m pretty sure that overglorified skeleton cozy is making a chump of us. 
Everybony chill a sec, the Maker® thinks, I’m maximizing the conjurer’s window. 
What was that, Sigrid asks?
Ah, nothing, you struggle to say. I was just talking about how I think you might be looking at the situation wrong.
No, I mean the nod. You were wasting more of my time with circular nonsense when you stopped and nodded.
It’s, ah… force of habit, trying to flick hair out of my eyes? Anyway what I mean is that the thing you were saying before is right, but I think I’m… righter. Maybe you could talk about that for a little bit? 
This stalling is tiresome, Katia. It’s not as though I’m going to kill you; I just want us to speak as equals – even if I have to achieve it through alchemical means. 
Wait wait wait! If you do the mind control perfume thing to make me like you, I might… not be able to tell you why I disliked you. R… right? 
Sigrid says nothing. You realize you might have found an angle to delay her, and push it.
Like, right now, I can talk at length about why I don’t like you and would try to resist your-

Through the conjurer’s sightless eyes, you gaze upon the magic-user before you. Even without her damnable Telvanni alchemy, she is quite clearly equipped for control. You count no less than three charm enchantments on her attire, most of them with physical activation switches for mana conservation – typical dark elf make. It’s not enough to conclude this is the sorceress who wronged you, but it’s close enough to be suspicious. 
The conjurer protests slightly at your prominence in their thoughts, but you dismiss it for the time being. 
Beyond the bound enchantments, there is one charm spell, definitely scroll-cast, and a few rudimentary wards. Running the sheer numbers, it’s impressive the conjurer is willfully standing against this witch as-is. 
Are there any more Bug Musk bottles around you, it wonders? If you can get your meaty phalanges on some, you might be able to convince her to wait while you fill out the registration forms. Are we really still on about the registration forms? With exasperation, you note that if you can find some way to charm her into submission, you won’t even need CairnCorp (®, the skeleton adds). The Maker®, in return, notes that that stings. 
There is a barrel of imp gall, you think. The Maker®, like you, recognizes it as an ingredient in the more rudimentary potions diplomats use to boost their charisma, and wonders if there’s any other reagents it could be mixed with. Nothing but water, you reply, and that won’t do anything to enhance the alchemical properties of the imp gall. If you weren’t panicked, you’d be a little proud you actually know this stuff now. 
The Maker® is silent. Then, it thinks: How much imp gall is there?
You… might see where this is going. A full barrel, you think. You’re blocked off from it by bars, though, and it’s too heavy for you to magically drag to the cage. With some help, you could potentially reach it, or even just beat the witch up directly. As in, you sure. Could. Use. SOME. HELP.
Sigrid isn’t saying anything. As your words peter out, Sigrid still says nothing. Until –
You know, Katia, I’ve been so dead-set on figuring out how you came to hate me so, I’ve been neglecting a much more interesting question: why are you so dead-set on stalling for time?
I’ll say it again: you’re not the type who would be saved by friends. If you truly do have any friends besides me, I suspect they’re the sort who merely tolerate you. But, you are an aspirant mage. And while lacking in both power and intelligence, you certainly are the kind of Khajiit who would try to cast her way out of a situation like this. You’d probably come up with an elaborate plan that could be completely ruined by, say, one magical silence spell.
I’m not casting any spells! The response comes out as a strained squeak as you struggle to maintain the unwieldy summoning spell and continue your telepathic conversation with the “Maker” (®, the Keeper™ adds). 
Strands of magicka weave together in what you assume is Sigrid’s hand. You can practically hear her smirk. If you’re not casting any spells, she says, then surely you wouldn’t mind if I cast a silence spell on you? 
Go ahead! Cast it! I promise you that I am not doing anything magical! 
Alright then, she says, I will.
W-wait, that was a bluff, can I go back a step?
With the sound of sparking magic, Sigrid thrusts her hand forward. You move to dodge, but the silencing spell strikes you and- 
Registration accepted, but your username is Slutty Meatsack and your default language is dragonling screams. Also, I’m looking at your leyline and it’s awful. I didn’t even know Mundus looped at the edges, you drew actual pictures with it on your way here, and pulling even our weakest model along this would take more mana than you will ever have in your life. 
Lucky for you, conjurer, the Telvanni are the worst, so I’m going to catalyze your Bonekin’s liminal transition and save your fleshy sacrum. But if I help you, you first have to do something for me…
You hear the clicking of a tube against a perfume bottle.
No matter. Relying on luck is unbefitting for someone of my stature, and predicaments like this are one of many reasons I’ve come to prefer an alchemical solution to these quarrels. 
But be proud, Miss Managan: I’ve brought down my last bottle of pure Bug Musk for this occasion, not the watered-down mess from last time.

“A skele-ton of skele-fun.”
“Good conjuration – we ain’t ribbing.”
“Gladiatorial calcium.”

In fact, let’s make this fun, Miss Managan. You’ll finally tell me everything I want to know, or I’ll make sure you die trying.

You are pretty sure there was some really good reason you weren’t supposed to talk right now, but at the same time you know Sigrid is using mind-altering alchemy bullshit and it’s probably filling in some of the blanks like it did last time. You kind of feel like you should be standing up to her as an independent person who doesn’t deserve to be ordered around like a slave, but you’re also pretty sure you only feel that way about yourself because you just ate half a barrel of magical charisma-slime and it’s screwing with your head. Everything Sigrid wants makes sense, but it also doesn’t feel right that she can bark commands at someone as smart, as pretty, as… infallible as you are. Even the imp gall running down your chin is coming across as badass and rugged-looking rather than disgusting, but since it was just a raw ingredient, you probably only have like twelve seconds before this effect wears off and

So, ah… are we cool now? Are you, like, not evil anymore? 
I think it would be a misnomer to call me evil, Sigrid says. But, with hindsight, and lacking several thousand septims worth of charms, I’ll concede my actions do seem a lot less tasteful. Would you believe this expensive falling cage trap once felt like a brilliant idea? Now the whole thing just seems chintzy and cliché.
This is actually my first falling-cage-trap experience, so I’m not a good judge. Can I leave?
Hm? Oh, yes, I figure we’re pretty much done here. While it’s certainly interesting how easily you overcome charms, I think we can all agree it’s not “interrogate you in a cage” levels of interesting. I am going to reactivate some basic wards, however, in case you jump out and punch me.
There are a lot of little voices in the back of my head kinda screaming for it. I mean, that’s it? You were being affected by your own charm spells, perfume, and magic clothing, and now that they’re all gone you’re just… letting me walk? 
Is it that surprising? As I said, you’re one of the rare few to have broken through these sorts of charms, so you should know what it’s like to realize everything you’ve been doing is inane and stupid. Not only that, but you used charm magic not even twenty minutes ago. Did you not see what it can do to one’s self-perceptions?
I… yeah, but I was shoveling raw imp gall into my face, basically doing the alchemy equivalent of mixing a drink in my mouth. You were using some professional charm perfume made by bigshot Telvanni wizards. Turning the user into an egotistical megalomaniac seems like a pretty big design flaw for them to…
Okay, no, this… this explains everything I’ve ever heard about the Telvanni. 
You never once found it strange how many of them are married to clones of themselves, Sigrid asks?
I’m sorry, I’m realizing a lot of obvious things about dark elves tonight.

So like, what’s the plan for the rest of the Telvanni Bug Musk? Or all the crazy charm-enchanted gear?
Well, the leylines on the dress and undergarments were no doubt shattered when I literally ripped them off my body. Nords may have no concept of shame, but that doesn’t mean we can just blink clothes off the way you do. Those rings and bracelets simply have wards and absorption spells, so I’d like to hang onto them. As for the charm boots, and the rest of the Bug Musk… given what they turned me into, I’ll probably just sell them. 
That, ah, seems like a really irresponsible way to dispose of super-powerful magic items?
Charm magic is common practice, Katia, and the entire spell school isn’t going to miraculously vanish off the face of Nirn if I burn some shoes. Any trained illusionist with a free weekend could learn the incantations, and any enchanter with a soul gem and some magetallow candles could imbue it into clothing. Charm magic isn’t exactly rare or difficult, and if it were, mages would simply resort to different, more destructive methods of bending others to their wills.
Welcome to wizardry, where people with awful ideas and no social skills invoke supernatural forces to gain power and respect. Almost makes you want to tap out and start a little shop selling healing potions. 
Wow, that’s… pessimistic. I mean, it’s not like every wizard is an evil jerk like you who wants to control everyone. Even the ones who learn mind control stuff, there’s probably a lot who use it responsibly, to like, stop bad people and make the world a better place.
You mean exactly how I was attempting to use it? You’re new to the practice of magic, Katia, so let me give you a lesson I apparently forgot: there’s no such thing as “good” or “evil”, just “powerful” and “powerless”. For their own safety, powerless people will work together in something we mistake as “good”, whereas those with access to power will stomp on whoever they can in the pursuit of some perceived greater good. 
So how about this: if you want to use powerful magic to make the world a better place, I’ll allow you to put my expensive magical equipment in the deepest part of a cave and then fill the cave with deadly traps. That way, the traps can take care of all the other mages who want to “make the world a better place”, and we’ll actually get something good from it. 
I mean, I’m just saying, I totally used your own mind control stuff against you to stop your evil reign and save Kvatch, so… fuck you, I’m right, magic is awesome.

Oh, right! In the commotion, you hadn’t even considered what happened to the skeleton. Feeling a little guilty about that, you quickly reach out with your magic to check in.
Just like the first time you contacted the skeleton, you are hit with an immediate wave of happiness. You can feel the skeleton’s thankfulness that you would contact CairnCorp®, and curiosity at how your will can best be served today.
You concentrate on the fact that you’re fine, and that you don’t need anything. You just wanted to thank it for its help and make sure it was okay after that big magical explosion. Both it and Sigrid’s daedra kind of disintegrated, so you’re not sure what happened to them.
The skeleton warmly reassures you that there is nothing† to worry about.

Your account has a current withdraw limit of 5000 septims (75300 Akaviri roundmarks) a day, although this will increase by 1000 (15060) for every CairnCorp®-brand soul gem you use for enchanting.
You ask what the black, squid-looking thing is. The skeleton tells you that new applicants also receive a free plush Wraithhorse™. Since CairnCorp seems amenable to feedback, you note that a skeleton made out of plush fabric doesn’t really work all that well. So on the conjuring, I can seriously just call on you no matter where I am, any time of day?
In any plane of existence as well, the skeleton notes – although using star tesseracts, you’d have to know the plane’s skies. Your free CairnCorp® Conjurer Account™ entitles you to check out one Soul Cairn® denizen at a time, at your own mana expense. If you are a career conjurer, however, you may consider filling out form A-26 and upgrading to a Platinum Account™, which allows the simultaneous summoning of up to six Soul Cairn® denizens and is available for the low price of your soul. 
Thanks, you think to the skeleton, but you’re good for now. You’ll keep the offer in mind. 
By the way, do you have a name?
The skeleton uneasily tells you that individuality like that doesn’t have a place in the Holy Ways™ of the Makers®. It is simply a skeleton.
Okay, it’s just, calling you “the skeleton” or “it” feels really impersonal. You kinda saved my life back there, and all of Kvatch. Can I give you a name?
The skeleton isn’t comfortable with how this relationship is progressing. It’s going to file a request with the Keeper™ to have a different skeleton take over your account from here on out.
Did I, ah, mess this up?

Hey, Sigrid, I don’t usually win things and I’m not sure how to handle this. The other day you took a robe, a package, and a purse of gold and stuff from me. Since I beat you in a magic duel am I, like, allowed to go get that now?
Sigrid says that you’re technically burgling her home, so “allowing” wouldn’t be the appropriate word for it. This place is covered by Guild insurance, though, and your entire goal is apparently to take roughly thirty septims’ worth of goods, so she won’t oppose you if you finish what you came here to accomplish. 
Okay, but like, can you tell me where the things are? Or give me a key? I always expect this post-battle victory stuff to be easy and intuitive, but instead it’s just really awkward and everyone is naked. You know there’s a bunch of robes in that crate right next to us, right?
Don’t be gross, Katia, those are necromancer robes. Anyway, I’m still the ranking member of this Guildhall and I don’t want to deal with the aftermath of aiding in its burglary. But, I also don’t really want to take any accountability for robbing you earlier, so if you’re good with calling this square as-is, I’m just going to fill out a New Applicant form and say you joined the Mages Guild last night. Welcome to the wonderful world of professional wizardry. Here’s your key, and help yourself to any silver daggers, calcinators, and various items that may or may not have been “left” upstairs. The gold would be in the pile with the rest, so just take a sack of it to cover losses.
I, ah, I’m still processing the “joined the Mages Guild” part, but when you say “sack”, are you talking like “coin purse” or “laundry bag”? 
You know, a money sack. The type people offer you huge amounts of money in when they perceive you as an apex of compassion and amenability within the local community. 
So like, a grocery bag? I don’t have a frame of reference for this and I’m scared.
Sure, yes, that’s fine. Just don’t take everything; if this ordeal is any indication, I’ll probably have to give a good amount of it back as reparations, apologies, and other unfortunate yet inevitable consequences of magical competence. Let’s not leave me with any additional problems beyond what I already have. 
And just to check: this isn’t some horrifying, hope-crushing trap? Like, you’re saying I can go upstairs, get my stuff back, and literally take a grocery bag full of gold?
Sigrid admits that she thought about signing you up for the Mages Guild and running away while you weren’t looking so you’d have to handle all the fallout of what she’s done, but she should probably just stop being a horrible person while she’s ahead. Perhaps it’s residual charm effects, or perhaps it’s simply the terrifying fact that you’re not grabbing the boots and Bug Musk to make her give you everything, but a grocery bag full of gold feels fair. 
And you’re not mad at me for ending your evil reign?
She says that it was probably inevitable anyway, and at least this way she avoided a dramatic “what have I become” moment and was instead defeated in a nude mime fight over thirty gold. She’d say this was a victory for everyone involved. 
And… I’m actually in the Mages Guild now? I can, like… go here or any Mages Guild in the world, read the books, eat the food, and sleep in the beds? 
If it sounds too good to be true, Sigrid says, remember that the government basically funds this to keep mages from going on angst-fueled killing sprees against the people who shunned them, and is only giving them food and education in the hopes they’ll direct their sociopathy away from the Empire.
I like the official tagline more: “the collection, preservation, and distribution of magical knowledge with an emphasis on ensuring that all citizens of Tamriel benefit from this knowledge”. I totally had a page from the charter hung on my wall when I was little.
But, ah, on that note, is the skeleton thing I did back there gonna cause problems? I heard about the guild recently banning necromancy, and I’m not sure if, like, I’m a necromancer now. 
Sigrid explains that the official rules say that the Soul Cairn falls on the “okay” side of the line, since the Ideal Masters reanimated those creatures and you’re simply summoning them. For the most part, people will just be astounded you were willing to tolerate the paperwork and bureaucracy. Most conjurers prefer to pull from the Deadlands, which is like a house with no locks and an owner who’s constantly angry that people are constantly stealing his pets and silverware. Or Infernace, which is more of a… laid back Soul Cairn.
A “laid back Soul Cairn”?

Oh, before I go, could I get you to sign this form saying that actually I am in the Mages Guild, the bag of gold I’m about to get was voluntarily given to me, and this isn’t some elaborate scheme to betray me and crush my tiny Khajiiti heart? 
Sigrid finds the precaution somewhat tedious, but concedes that it’s probably justified given she’s betrayed you in an elaborate scheme every day since you met. Why’s the contract written in imp gall on a page of nightwriting? 
You tell her it’s because she took your only pencil and paper. You hadn’t really thought about it until now, but makeshift papers and writing utensils are pretty much the main thing your inventory items get used for. It’s actually kind of amazing how much simpler your life will become once you own a notebook and pencil. 
Merry Saturalia, then: you can keep this pen. Anyway, since I’m the ranking member at this Guildhall, my signature on this should be sufficient proof of your Guild membership. It won’t be one-hundred-percent official until I get the papers to the Imperial City, but I’ll send them with the next patrolling guard. Unless you’re headed that way? 
Nah, I’ve got a courier job taking me the opposite way, back to the coast. A friend’s waiting for me, so I kinda want to get that finished rather than taking up a zillion more quests. You know, one thing at a time. 
Nopon wrote: Katia: Move quest “Miasma of Megalomania” to your completed quest list. Make “A Simple Delivery Job” your active quest.CustodianoftheDice wrote: Okay, time to update that quest log!
First you’ll need a “Completed Quests” section since you actually managed to complete a quest and also not die. Go ahead and put “get stuff back from Sigrid” in there. 
Now you need to set some new active quests.
1: Buy Quill-Weave a replacement book. That’s like the reason you came to Kvatch, so don’t forget to do it.
2: Return the Arena gear to the Orc. You’re not going to compete now, so it would be kind of a dick move to keep it when you have actual clothes to wear.
3: Find and apologise to Capt. Atrum. Maybe he’ll have calmed down and can tell you more.
4: Wait for ASOTIL to come back and travel to Anvil with him. You’re far more competent now, but there’a no reason to take unnecessary risks by traveling alone.
And speaking of quests…
You rip your quest log in half to create a fancy new Completed Quests section. The whole Sigrid thing is clear, and joining the Mages Guild is clear. Just to fill the list a little more, you mark the dance competition as clear too, since it requires an arena raiment; yours was shot with ice bolts, set on fire, soaked in blood, pierced full of holes, and torn apart to make a plate for a dog. Rest in peace, Kvatch arena raiment. 
Other than some miscellaneous stuff like punching Rajirra for being a dick and apologizing to Captain Atrum for being a dick, it looks like your top priority is buying the replacement book, meeting up with Asotil, and heading back to Quill-Weave’s. You’ve been dealing with this Kvatch stuff for so long that it feels almost surreal to have everything… just moving forward. 
Sigrid, by the way, is there like a loan program or something for the magic books upstairs? Can I take some with me, learn all the spells, and become the best wizard ever? 
Probably no to most of that, Sigrid says, but the books are public Guild property so you’re free to take what you need. 
And alchemy equipment, am I allowed to take a full set of it? Like, with the burny thing, the grindy thing, the tubey one, and the other? 
If you take the Guild rules completely literally, you can take as many sets as you want. The government doesn’t care. You know, this would be a lot easier if you’d just act like a Khajiit. 
I know, I know, I’m sorry. Anyway, you said I could take “silver daggers”. Was that a hyperbole, or are they like the alchemy equipment where I can just kind of take as many as I want?
Really, Sigrid says, just take whatever. You’re starting to make it very embarrassing to have lost a magic duel to you.
Sorry, I’m just excited that all this hassle finally has a silver lining.
She got it! Did you get it?
You know, Sigrid, without all the weird megalomania-inducing mind control stuff, you’re really not that bad. Sigrid points out that she’s done nothing but encourage you to steal things and abuse public services. Okay, you say, so you’re objectively bad, but I still feel like you’re the kind of person I could conceivably be friends with. Like, someday. It’s been like thirty minutes since we were enemies, so my emotions are complicated. And possibly influenced by a charm-magic hangover, but I think I hope not?
Iiiiii’m just gonna leave before I make this weirder by continuing to talk. Sorry. Bye.

You’re not “likely to get robbed”. People travel between adjacent towns all the time without getting robbed, and just in case you’re somehow the exception, you already set up a plan to go with Asotil or another patrolling soldier traveling the same road. Random highwaymen aren’t going to pose any threat when you have an Imperial Legionnaire watching your back. 
Tonight should be all the proof you need that the universe isn’t completely out to get you, and that sometimes, things turn out alright. While you’ve certainly learned an important lesson about caution, that doesn’t mean you have to expect everything in your life to backfire disastrously. 
Huh, what’s that orange glow coming from outside?

It’s a beautiful sunrise!
Also, someone across the street is cooking breakfast on a smoky outdoor grill. You have a good feeling about today.

Ordinarily you’d be all over the idea of getting a fresh-cooked meal from complete strangers, but you literally just ate a slab of raw venison about thirty seconds ago. And that’s after eating a gallon of mashed imp organs, an unusually large potato, another slab of venison on your way down into the ritual chamber, maybe a few spiderwebs, half a sweetroll, and an entire fish. Honestly, you’ve gotten so fluent at wordlessly eating everything you walk past that it actually might be time to reel this once-useful survival instinct back a little. 
Anyway, you are on a mission. You came in here to get Quill-Weave’s package back, not be distracted by every trivial thing that pops into your mind.

Aha! 
Okay, wow, this is actually way too much clothing for once. You stow the invisibility cloak in your inventory for the time being; you’ll figure out some tasteful way to combine your outfits later. For now, you are on a quest to get Quill-Weave’s package back, and nothing will stop you.

I mean, you didn’t want something to stop you, but at this point you were kind of expecting it. You guess everything is just back on track now. 
Woah woah woah… Does this mean that we can just… do things without worrying about accidentally slipping on a puddle of blood, flying out the nearest window and impaling ourselves on a particularly spikey fence stake? Colour me sceptical.
You’re somewhat conflicted over it. On one hand, things are going eerily well and you don’t trust it. In your experience, moments like this only exist to raise your hopes up long enough to dash them, or cause you to fall into super-obvious traps due to overconfidence. Narratively speaking, you’re basically fucked. 
But, on the other hand, all the things happening to you right now are actually pretty… normal. Someone who learns magic would usually end up in the Mages Guild and be given free room and board. Someone who helps a wealthy sorceress out of a mind-control spell would usually be given a big reward. Someone looking for a package while knowing the exact room it was stored in would usually find it. None of these “strokes of luck” are actually that lucky; they’re just kind of what would happen to a normal person in your position. Assuming that the universe is actively out to fuck you over might be overestimating how much the universe actually cares about you. 
Or worse: worrying that this is some ominous sign of impending doom might be sapping all the joy from what is essentially you achieving all your dreams. 
You explain your feelings to the daedra and ask what she thinks. She says this topic is a little heavy for her, and she was actually hoping to head down to that barbecue. She saw some corn cobs out there, so she was gonna go demonstrate an X-rated method of making popcorn then disappear back to Infernace before the Nirn Police can get her for public indecency. You thank the daedra for her brutal honesty and tell her this conversation has provided a new and uncomfortable perspective on how you probably come across to others.
You’re hardly an expert on conjuration, but you don’t think you’d get much from just blindly exploring the skies with your magic-vision. The only reason you were able to reach the Soul Cairn was because you knew the exact six stars to look at and how far to follow each of them along their… length? And even then, it wasn’t as though you were just flipping through a four-dimensional stack of planes connected by star-tubes: each star was like its own coordinate, and you were perfectly able to find planes that were at the same position along five of the stars and a different position along the sixth. You can barely wrap your giant cat head around the sheer scale of it, but one thing is for certain: probability of finding anything out there by chance is extremely low. 
But… you probably should study conjuration a bit more now that you’ve learned the basics. On the off chance things do suddenly go horribly wrong and your entire world comes predictably crashing down around you, it would be pretty handy to have on-call protectors you can just pull to Nirn whenever you want. Plus, you’re in the Mages Guild now. After you pick up a new copy of that grammar book and take it to Quill-Weave, you guess reading books and learning to cast spells all day is… basically your job?
There is also a lot of non-conjuration magic you could study.

Anyway-
You doubt the local guards would be willing – or allowed – to abandon their post and escort you all the way back to Quill-Weave’s. However, Asotil did say they’d have a copy of his patrol schedule. If you understand right, he travels back and forth between the two towns every day, so it will be easy to join him on the trip as long as you know when he’ll be arriving at Kvatch. 
Of course, before you leave you still need to buy Quill-Weave a new copy of this grammar book you defaced, and you still probably have at least an hour before the bookstore opens. If nothing else, though, a solid plan begins to form in your head: visit the bookstore, get the patrol schedule from the town guard, and head back to Quill-Weave’s. It feels good to have everything back on track.

I mean, you’re honestly pretty proud of how well you managed to re-wrap Quill-Weave’s package, and don’t want to do your usual thing where you mess stuff up once it’s good. Plus, Quill-Weave is an author, so she probably likes to get her books super new and unopened so she can do the thing with them. You know, the bendy thing. Book people do it. 
If you want to read the book, though, there’s literally another copy of it right here on the shelf. You take Principles of Restoration and add it to your inventory, since you’re a Mages Guild member and can do that. 
You’re starting to get what Sigrid was saying earlier. If you were a violent and evil wizard, you kinda feel like the sheer convenience of the Mages Guild would deter you from working against the Empire.

Baker wrote: Best angle: a swan dive right into it. BloodSung wrote: Dive in that gold, Duck Tales style!
Okay, so –
First of all, even the bigger of these two gold piles is like two and a half feet deep at most. That might be pretty deep as far as mountains of gold go, but it’s shallow enough that any swan dive would be a faceplant.
Second, piles of tightly-packed metal pieces don’t exactly move around like water. This means it would still be a faceplant, except a faceplant onto metal, two and a half feet earlier than expected. 
And third, growing up in the desert never taught you how to swim. So even if the pile were deeper, and sheer force of will could cause the coins to flow around you, you’d just drown in a giant pool of money. Really, every part of this plan is bad and it bothers you that swimming in the gold is the most prominent thought on your mind. 
Makoto wrote: The right angle is the low one, with a big open coin bag ready to grab the shinies. Micro wrote: 90°?
You’ve got to approach this strategically. Grabbing an appropriately grocery-sized bag from the storage room, you position yourself low to the ground, placing the bag adjacent to the huge stack of gold coins. With this optimal and carefully-planned setup, filling the bag should be a piece of cake. You’ve just got to scrape at a few of the coins on the surface and let them tumble in, where they will legally become part of your giant bag of money. 
You really shouldn’t be having so much trouble with this, especially as a Khajiit.

Try and figure out how much you need to look and feel like a semi respectable member of society. You basically just need a basic adventuring kit (backpack, bedroll, compass, etc) and some spending money for food and future supplies. Don’t be greedy, but take what’s needed to keep yourself from being on the streets again.

It occurs to you moments too late that eating something will not actually make it lighter than carrying it normally. 
On the bright side, you now know that money tastes awful and you should never do this again. On the less-bright side, there is a sharp diamond somewhere in your digestive tract and you should probably avoid any strenuous rolling and dodging for a while.

Actually, thinking about it…
Now that you’re in the Mages Guild, you probably get some kind of locker in the Guildhalls where you can leave stuff you’re not using. Instead of leaving behind half the bag of money, you could probably just leave behind some of the other items in your inventory.
You obviously want to hold onto Quill-Weave’s package, the invisibility cloak, the contract confirming your Mages Guild membership, and the key to the Guildhalls. Some of this other stuff might be less important to carry on you at all times, though, such as the lightning spellbook, the guide to healing magic, the unborn potted plant, the broken walking stick, the bent piece of metal, the four
wolf teeth, the handful of regular grass blades, the old paintbrush you found, the defaced book about cross-cultural grammar differences, the neck gaiter that came with your thief outfit, Sigrid’s pen, 
the skeleton horse plushie, the promotional pamphlet about the Soul Cairn, the soul gem, the alchemy book for blind people, the six copies of the same conjuration
spellbook, the cotton eye bandage, the lockpick, the second page of that letter the vampire left you, the key to the Chapel of Akatosh, the key to the Chapel of Akatosh undercroft, the key to Sigrid’s meat cellar, the top half of your broken hatchet, any of the eleven silver daggers, the six alchemical retorts, the six alembics, the three iron calcinators, the two mortars and pestles, or the leather strap and coinpurse. 
But what if you find yourself in a situation where you need a handful of grass blades?

You wouldn’t say it “lightened the load” since you’re carrying the exact same amount of grass and also a glass bottle, but you are now the proud owner of a poison resistance potion. Should some nefarious fiend ever poison you, you can just pop the cork off this baby and… slowly die while you struggle to shake the glob of grass and foxglove nectar off the bottom of the bottle. In retrospect, you were probably supposed to add water.
But whatever, it’s still the first real potion you’ve made and you’re proud.

Already done! Your sneaky purple outfit and broken armor are safely back in your inventory – which, by the way, has been culled down to a tidy eighteen items after meticulously tallying up your every thought about what should and shouldn’t be left behind. By popular demand, you even split them into three categories: “miscellaneous”, “clothing”, and “actually important”. 
(The “miscellaneous” category also has the map of Cyrodiil you forgot was tucked in the grammar book. Taking inventory is hard.) 
With this new, streamlined inventory, you were able to make off with 628 septims – about a 30 pound bag. On top of that, you stuffed an extra hundred septims in the leather coinpurse and hid it in a SECRET PLACE in case you somehow lose all your money again. You know that sounds like a euphemism, but it’s not. You stuck it under some rocks in that hatch leading to the chapel undercroft. 
As for using your newfound conjuration skills to summon money and items to you, you’re pretty sure it doesn’t work like that? You haven’t read up on all the details yet, but when you connected to the Soul Cairn, it wasn’t as though you were reaching somewhere far away. It was like they were right on top of you, just… in a weird direction. If there’s a way to magically reach out to items somewhere else on Nirn, you expect it’s different – and harder – than reaching things in the Soul Cairn. 
Though, they did say that summoning with them gave you a complementary savings account.
You aren’t sure what you’re supposed to do with this. 
The quantity doesn’t exactly matter much in your case. After one drink you’d somehow end up getting more drinks no matter what, and still manage to burn through all your money regardless. 
But, you do acknowledge that it would be completely possible to go get a celebratory drink right now. And you’re completely planning to, you’re just putting it off for a bit while you focus on a few more immediate priorities, such as checking when Asotil’s patrol reaches Kvatch, traveling with him back to Anvil, delivering Quill-Weave’s package, moving into the Mages Guild and becoming a successful wizard, and living happily ever after for the rest of your life. 
You reassure yourself that after that you’re totally gonna get blasted. But, priority one: getting Asotil’s patrol schedule.

Hey, this might be a weird question, but… would you have any interest in traveling back to Anvil with me?
What, Gaius asks, drop his duties to act as your personal bodyguard? There’s a Fighter’s Guild full of bored mercanaries who would happily take the role.
No, I mean like, so we can figure out more about the nightmare thing. Out of all the people and Khajiit on Nirn, some mysterious entity made you and me in particular have these nightmares. Nightmares about two very specific things, and both starting around the same year. There has to be some plan or motivation behind it, and if we could spend more time comparing the similarities and differences between our experiences, we’d be that much closer to decoding it. I have a courier job to finish, but you’re the best lead I’ve found on this, and it sounds like I’m the best lead you’ve found too. And like… I want to know if you’re into the idea of talking this out further while coming with me back to the coast.
A little.
Is that, like, a yes, or…?
It’s “a little”, Gaius says. Assuming everything you’ve said about your king-nightmares is truthful, then you’re right: between the two of us, we might be able to narrow down their cause. At the same time, though, I’m not sure how much you can be trusted. Consider it from my perspective: after fourteen years of unholy nightmares instilling a completely reasonable and justified apprehension of cultists, an ex-cultist suddenly shows up purporting to have similar nightmares and wanting me to come discuss it further. If I were royalty, and I posed such an offer to you, would you trust me and accept it?
Probably not, but I kind of expect others to be more rational than me with this stuff. 
Hence “a little”. I might not fully believe you, but I do want to know more about your experiences with the nightmares. I’m not ready to take vacation days so a serial-cultist of allegedly-benign motives can lure me into the woods, but if you’re willing to spend some more time in Kvatch, I’m not averse to your presence.
Aww, you like me! Gaius explains that there’s a large gap between “not being averse to someone’s presence” and “liking them”. You tell him your bar is really low and this counts as a win. He is your friend now, there is no escape. 
But no, like, I really need to get this courier job done; a friend is counting on me. I also want to meet up with the Legionnaire who took me here, to show him I’m doing okay and have actual money and skills now. He believed in me, and I kind of want to show him his investment paid off. His belief investment. It’s complicated. It’s a thing. 
Right, Gaius says. You’ll be coming back to Kvatch though, I hope?
I mean, probably? It’s not like the city’s gonna just disappear. We’re nightmare buddies now, we’ve gotta figure shit out.

While hiring or conjuring a bodyguard is definitely an option, they would 1.) cost probably a third your money or all your magicka, 2.) pale next to the unparalleled protection of the Imperial Legion, and 3.) not be proud of you for completely turning your life around. The option is still on the table if some unexpected horrible disaster somehow causes you to miss Asotil, but your current plan is to not miss him.

Honestly, you have a bunch of books to read, so you don’t have a problem with just waiting out in front of town until you see him approach the base of the mountain. There’s a nice rock out there that’s in sight of the town guards while simultaneously giving you a good view of the road below. 
Before you set up your little camp, you still need to get the new book for Quill-Weave and spend a couple updates doing one final comprehensive shopping trip around town. If Asotil usually shows up at 5:00 PM, and his schedule was moved either forward or backward by a maximum of six hours, that gives you a good…
Oh fuck.

Still. Better safe than sorry. 

Not today, bad ideas! Up here you have a nice, elevated vantage point that lets you see for miles, whereas down there you’d be surrounded by hills and trees. Even if you didn’t instantly get eaten by bears or fall down the mountain and break both your legs (which, let’s be honest, would absolutely happen), you’d just be making it even harder to spot the person you’re looking for.
Plus, if he had shown up and left a couple minutes early, you’d still be able to see him on the road from here. And just in case he showed up super early:
Hey, you call up to the wall guard. Did you see an Imperial Legionnaire come by?
‘Fraid not, the wall guard says. 
Okay, thanks, you say. 
There. The guard didn’t see anything, and his whole job is to pay attention to his surroundings and make sure nothing potentially dangerous is happening near the city. 
And just in case the guard is slacking off and missing things, you double check with the Dagon cultist. He confirms that no Legionnaires have come near the town. You thank him, offer him a sweetroll, and ask if he’ll take one up to the wall guard too, if he’s headed in anyway.

I mean a lot changed really fast
Asotil being late wouldn’t surprise you. Apparently, protocol mandates he stop and kill every potentially-threatening animal he sees (which you witnessed a lot of on the way here). Plus, there’s always a chance that his schedule-shift was denied, or that it got shifted less than six hours, in which case he could show up at any time. Everything is going great right now, so you want to make sure you don’t step away the exact moment he shows up. 
As for your inventory, your new acquisitions are a bottle of milk, a box of glazed sweetrolls, a new set of arena armor, the new grammar book for Quill-Weave, a “leek” (weird Cyrodiil onion), some magicka-restoring mushrooms you’re pretty sure you sold the shopkeeper yesterday for way less than you paid today, and a bag of coffee beans. 
You aren’t exactly sure how to turn coffee beans into coffee, but you figure you can work that out while waiting. You know roasting is involved at some point in the process. Presumably not the step that makes it hot at the end, since you’re pretty sure it’s not called roasting when done to liquid. It’s just… heating. 
Nope! Everything you sit on is warm and comfy. 
Those couple months you were shaved were the first and last time you experienced the horrifying world everyone else lives in. There is literally one advantage to having fur, and this is it. 
Okay, you’re pretty much over sweetrolls now. You absolutely did not need to get the box of 24.
That sounds like a good reason to get a grip on healing magic before trying the lightning out. Though on the other hand, learning magic the proper way (as in, reading a book) probably involves a lot less injury than your ordinary “desperate experimentation” style of learning, so starting with healing may not matter.
You’re not sure how long you have, so you guess you have three choices of where to start. It could be pretty useful to get a basic grip on healing magic, but it’s also a new type of magic you know absolutely nothing about and don’t even have accidental experience with. Lightning, on the other hand, might come to you more naturally since you already have a tenuous grip on fire, but having another way to burn things wouldn’t exactly mean as much. It’s not like you and Asotil are going to get jumped by an evil bandit who can somehow only be hurt by magic that’s not flames. 
Then there’s also the option of reading more into conjuration. Even if you technically did use conjuration magic already, it was only one time, it was based off a single diagram you saw in the book, and the Ideal Master said your “leyline was too sloppy” to have been usable without help – meaning there’s a lot you might still have to learn just to do it again. Plus, unlike the other magic, you actually have someone you can turn to if you need a hand learning it. Which… you guess kind of makes thematic sense, for conjuration. It’s basically just calling for help, even if it’s technically breaching the barrier between universes and cavorting with ageless, inhuman entities. 
Or option four: you could try to make coffee.

Okay, okay, fine. 
Despite having three potentially life-saving new magical skills you could spend this time learning, you overwhelmingly conclude that the best course of action is to attempt making coffee, despite having no knowledge of how to do so. With any luck, getting a little more wakefulness in you will keep you from making dumb decisions, such as this one you are making right now. 
Plus, depending how long this takes, you might end up having time to read a book afterwards anyway. A giant cat can hope. 
They are brown! You guess that means they’re already cooked? 
Yeah, it has that “burnt wood” texture.

You guess you just let it steep now, like tea? Unless you made some horrible unforeseen mistake, that was actually surprisingly easy and disaster-free. 
Also, Asotil didn’t show up in the last five minutes, meaning you still have time to work on your spells. 
You… haven’t really ever thought much about that.
A week ago you didn’t even know someone like you could do magic. If it had turned out all you were capable of casting was some simple little light spell, you still would’ve been overjoyed about it, and probably gone around calling yourself the Light Wizard. 
But having every route suddenly open to you like this, and people asking what sort of things you’re interested in and what you want to do? It just kind of makes you realize that you don’t know. You never thought it through this deeply, since planning for something unattainable would just make you sad.  
You do have a vested interest in not dying horribly. You also seem to have an increasing propensity for getting horribly injured. Plus, since it’s a new type of magic you’ve never tried, maybe it’ll be the one that clicks something inside you and makes you go “wow! This is what I want to do forever!”. 
If nothing else, being a master of the healing arts at least sounds more dignified and sophisticated than being a fireball-thrower.

DO. NOT. GIVE. UP.
You haven’t given up yet. But, you’re also not exactly making much headway.
You understand the concept. As the book has repeatedly gone out of its way to emphasize, healing magic is very simple. You’re supposed to hold onto a mental picture of how things were, and then regurgitate it onto how things are. The scant few pages on actual theory described it as “moving little bits of time”, which definitely sounds pretty neat on paper.
The problem is that it’s not leaving the paper. According to the book, pulling the memory into reality is the part of the spell that expends magicka, but storing the memory beforehand is the part that beginners mess up. If the healing spell does not work, it means your imaginary snake did not properly eat the comic panel or whatever, so you have to start over with something new to heal. This time, “believing in yourself harder”. 
That… isn’t what the metaphor meant. 
The author foresaw this confusion, though, and had an entire page explaining that you weren’t supposed to literally eat the book.

Well, your coffee turned out okay at least. You were kind of hoping it would turn the milk brown, but it still tastes like coffee. 
As for Asotil, you’ve been glancing down at the road practically every page (which is frequently, considering each page has maybe five sentences). So far, you haven’t even seen so much as a courier. Imperials are notoriously regimented, though, so if Asotil said he’d request a six hour shift in his schedule, there’s a good chance he’ll show up exactly six hours from the original time.
Not so good of a chance that you’re willing to wait inside, though. Six hundred septims and a successful cup of coffee isn’t enough to make you start trusting your luck again.
“Good girl” would usually feel a bit demeaning, but you think Scleepy has lowered your standards enough to appreciate it. Thanks.
And you already tried wearing the cloak and robe together; it was a little cumbersome for your tastes. Remember that you basically have a full-body fur coat under everything you wear, and that it’s the middle of summer. 
You are carrying three complete outfits at this point, though, each with lots of interchangable parts. If you wanted to make the invisibility cloak or even armor part of your normal wear, you could probably find some fancy and aesthetic way to combine the different pieces. It could be a nice little break from declawing yourself at the behest of a cartoon snake.
Plus, you’re pretty sure Asotil will suddenly show up right when you’re changing. That seems like the sort of thing that would happen to you, and you’re willing to capitalize on it if it means meeting up with him and getting back to Quill-Weave’s.

Okay, for one, you have no claws left on any of your hands or feet. For two, you saw how practicing on your claws turned out, right? Given that you need some kind of new bodily damage every time the spell fails to take, moving on to actual wounds seems like a slippery slope that will end nowhere good. 
You thank the very confused textile merchant for helping you frame the visual gag, and keep true to your promise to buy a scarf afterwards. 
When asked about Imperial Legionnaires, he reports seeing a few between here and Elsweyr, but all headed the opposite way as him. You tell him he’s very nice for a khajiit. He’s not sure how to take that and says he wants to go now. 
While the book is frustratingly light on details, the later pages do give a bit of justification for why it had you practicing on yourself. 
Apparently, healing other people is something that only comes once you’ve mastered the basics. It’s not just a matter of storing someone’s uninjured state and willing them back to it: it involves storing your own uninjured state and willing it onto them. In the words of the cheerful cartoon snake, “you have to learn to catch before you can juggle”. 
The book goes on to explain that “Restoration” is a misnomer, and that a practiced master can move beyond simple healing. They can temporarily displace entire experiences into someone’s history, giving them education or training they never received. The first step to this, though, is the basic self-healing spell: learning how to bottle up a little piece of time and release it right back where you got it. And that “incredibly simple” thing seems to be what you’re stuck on.
You’re not going to eat the book.
Fireballs involved emotion. When you learned telekinesis, though, it was completely different; you were giving tiny little pushes to the magical properties of things to make them work a different way. And when you briefly used conjuration, it was different from both of them, with you navigating through extradimensional space by the stars.
The fact that the Mages Guild had entirely different sections on the bookshelves for different magic types suggests that each one probably has its own theory and principles. There might be some overlap – you did manage to get a tiny bit of telekinesis from a bird pun, and started the conjuration spell with the normal blue line stuff – but you wouldn’t count on the secret to Restoration being something as simple as a different kind of wordplay. 
For all you know, it might not even be something you can approach like a puzzle. The snake did say intelligence wasn’t a factor, and that if it didn’t work, you had to “believe in yourself harder”.

Nope, it wasn’t.
Unless that was. You have wasted two fire spells worth of magicka confirming you have magicka, and you still don’t know. 
Also: Asotil still hasn’t shown up. You didn’t forget, you’re still checking. 
You don’t… think that’s the issue? Sure, you’ve had plenty of times where you comforted yourself with lies, but you feel like your overall self-perception isn’t off base. It might seem like you’re hard on yourself sometimes, but really you just have a lot of problems and you’re extremely aware of them. And you’re not blind to the good things about yourself, either! Like, you did a cool thing last night and saved the day. Plus, you’ve been in Cyrodiil for less than a week and have already become a hundredaire. A high-end hundredaire too, over halfway to thousandaire. You’re okay.
And if your self-perception is screwed up in some weird way you don’t understand… well, that just makes you feel a little worse about yourself. Like, there’s something broken inside you that you can’t see, and it’s keeping you from learning the magic spell you want to learn. The thought is making you sad, which is pretty much the opposite of the snake’s advice to “believe in yourself”.
Maybe it’s time to take that break to mess with your clothes.

Well for one: these greens don’t get along at all. It’s like someone was halfway through a painting and had to remix all their colors, but ran out of yellow. You know aesthetics should come second to practicality, but there’s still a line you’d rather not cross. 
Even on a practicality level, though, this is just throwing on even more layers on your body in the middle of summer. It’s not adding any actual armor, and honestly, if you needed to turn invisible, you could get the invisibility cloak out of your inventory about as fast as you could put up the hood.

That, though… is actually surprisingly functional. It’s good for walking, good for riding, good for summer, and doesn’t scream “rob me, I’m a high-end hundredaire”. You’d have to alter the sleeves a little, but it’s nothing you can’t handle with a silver dagger and a dangerous amount of believing in yourself.

The guard is on a different part of the wall right now and the merchant is inside. Plus, changing clothes is a very functional and purposeful thing, so it won’t be too weird if someone sees you. Though, hopefully still awkward enough to make Asotil show up. You stand on the away-from-the-city side of the rock just to be safe. 
The slow kind of seduction has never exactly been what you were known for, but you figure it’s basically just changing clothes but slower.

Anyway, are you sure the “blue line” magic visualization is part of healing magic? Perhaps it’s holding you back, sticking to something that might be leading in the wrong direction?
You’re glad you look good! You feel like you managed to hit the fine line between “looking nice” and “looking like you’re not carrying money”. Given your experiences these last few days, you figure that’s probably the right place to be.
As for the “blue line” magic: you absolutely aren’t sure if it’s the right thing to do here. It’s just kind of how you’ve been imagining magic.
Neither the book you read nor anyone else you’ve spoken to have said anything about blue lines – plus, magic looked all angular and purple when the Ideal Master took over your vision. It might just be a subjective thing nobody sees the same way, in which case you feel like it shouldn’t matter how you visualize healing?
In the interest of experimentation, though, you imagine a more realistic cartoon snake vomiting comic panels on your hand. It doesn’t heal your claws, but it does succeed in making the experience much, much more uncomfortable.

It’s been a little longer than that. Closer to three. 
Asotil said he’d request a six hour shift in his schedule. It’s most likely he’ll show up either three hours from now (if the schedule shift didn’t get approved and he arrives the normal time) or nine hours from now (if it was shifted six hours forward, not back). It’s also possible he is running ahead of or behind schedule, in which case he could show up at any time.
Even if he doesn’t show up until nighttime, though, you’ll at least have lots of time to read books and practice things. Probably behind timeskips.
Like that one right there. You got tired of sitting so you ran into town to use the bathroom, ran back to the rock to make sure Asotil wasn’t visible on the road (either coming or going), then back into town again where you bought a toy crossbow that shoots toothpicks. You’ve almost gotten good at using it. Back to magic now.
Right. You close your eyes and try to forget about all the swirly blue lines and complexities of magic.
You focus on the you in the past. The you that had claws. The you that was “stored” in your mind while preparing to cast the healing spell. 
You are that you. She is you. You are one and the same, and the separation of time does not change that.
You are not trying to heal. You are healed.
Yeah, it didn’t work. You are still clawless, and that guard on the wall probably thinks you’re doing some kind of very-low-energy yoga routine. 
(Hard mode: . . . and is also not a skill?)
That just sounds like a very roundabout way of asking “do you like being a talking animal that panics about everything”. 
And no, you take more pride in the fact that you worked stuff out okay despite being a talking animal that panics about everything. 
Believing in yourself takes time, patience, courage and forgiveness. It doesn’t happen overnight, or because a book tells you to. It happens because you learn to forgive yourself for your failures, and accept what they are without letting them become who -you- are. It happens because you keep trying, and because bit by bit you gain little victories which remind you that you -can- accomplish things, even if it’s hard or you had help along the way.
If that’s true, you guess you’re supposed to just… wait until you believe in yourself more? Waiting until you get better feels a little antithetical to the entire idea of healing magic, but maybe there’s some part of you that’s just not ready for healing yet. After you spend some time being a competent and successful mage without huge problems all the time, maybe something you can’t see right now will just click and you’ll be able to use healing magic too.
Or maybe you’re overthinking this and are getting too dramatic for a magic type that can apparently be taught to illiterate people by a cartoon snake. 
Well, whatever. If you’re giving up and going back to what you’re good at, at least “what you’re good at” is more respectable than it used to be. And these last few hours weren’t a complete loss: you learned the limits of your abilities. Those limits are higher than you thought they were a week ago, but you guess they’re still… there.

First of all, about those files…
You hope to the skeleton that you might be able to tweak a few of the details that were entered last time. Your initial registration was expedited a bit due to the situation you were in, but now that things have cleared up you’d like to correct some minor inaccuracies. 
The skeleton notes with a tinge of disappointment that a number of the basic account setup questions, such as the registrant’s name and birthday, are set at the time of registration and cannot be adjusted[1]. This is part of the reason new users are encouraged to prepare their account well in advance[2] and double-check answers thoroughly for spelling mistakes. 
It wasn’t really a “spelling mistake” so much as the Ideal Master (®, the skeleton adds) throwing in a bunch of answers to get the account made more quickly. You were a little too busy to care much at the time, but now that you’re no longer in mortal peril and summoning might become a regular thing for you, you’d kind of like to change your name away from “Slutty Meatsack”.
The skeleton reemphasizes that your registration name cannot be adjusted at a later date[1], as your information has already been added to the Holy System™ in the appropriate alphabetical location. Additionally, if the exalted Maker®, chose your name, it is most certainly an excellent name and the skeleton cannot comprehend why a change would be desired or necessary. 
Would it be possible to at least change the language to something other than Dragonish?
Language preferences are indeed fully adjustable‡‡. In the interest of providing better service for you and other customers going forward, would you be willing to provide the reason for the change?
Your Dragonish is a bit limited, you think in response. Also, you’re pretty sure dragonlings don’t have a written language. That ream of papers the skeleton is holding just has “<SCREAMING>” written repeatedly on every page.
The skeleton can see where this might be a potential inconvenience. A prayer has been sent to the Makers®, and your language preferences should be updated within 3-10 business days.

The snake is imaginary! It can feel neither hot nor cold. There is no reason to worry about its wellbeing.
You can give it sassy little arms and make it give a thumbs up, though. Hopefully that’s enough to pretend it’s happy and comfortable.

Aaanyway, so, next point of business: I’m still pretty new to this whole “dealing with otherworldly entities” thing. I’m wondering, what exactly is the… model, here? Do I give you something in exchange for you sending skeleton people to me?
For legal reasons, the skeleton clarifies that CairnCorp® does not send “skeleton” “people”. You pull bonekin from the Soul Cairn® using basic conjuration technique as you would from any Daedric plane, while CairnCorp® ensures your conjured aid is fully repaired and readily available when you need it, as well as providing customer service and manaback guarantees‡‡† in the rare case that problems should arise. 
As an ordinary conjurer, you won’t be buying from CairnCorp® directly. Rather, new conjuration codes will be purchased through one of our licensed resellers. Upon using a code, it is securely and nontransferably bound to your account and will remain uniquely yours until you have been fully dead‡‡‡ for at least two years, whereupon your account is automatically closed. Your Free Conjurer Account entitles you to summon one (1) Soul Cairn denizen at a time, although this number increases if you choose to upgrade to a Platinum Account™.
Okay, you think, that seems almost suspiciously non-evil. There’s no secret trick here to take over my mind or steal my soul?
CairnCorp® prides itself on an inviting environment and friendly customer service. We would never steal your soul, although we offer competitive‡‡‡† rewards should you sign it over voluntarily. If a customer is on the fence about this decision, we encourage them to seriously consider whether they had any better plans or prospects for their soul.
Alright, so, I’m gonna change the topic before I start thinking about that too hard. 
Maybe someone higher up there is looking to branch beyond mere conjuration services and wanted to experiment in the realm of nightmares?
It could be some kind of inception based advertising campaign… make people feel vulnerable so that they want to summon some osseous defenders? Of course if that were true you’d expect to see some branding by the end of the dream… but what if you’ve been waking up in a cold sweat just before the logo reveal every time?
Third question. It’s a longshot, but… just to check, do you guys ever tamper with dreams?
CairnCorp® is a high-quality provider of conjuration services[4]. Altering dream states falls outside the purview of their business[5]. 
I mean, not as a business thing, but maybe as advertising? Have you ever given people scary dreams to make them see your company name, or feel like they need skeletal defenders? Anything like that?
The skeleton recalls that a nightmare-based marketing campaign was proposed at a meeting several centuries ago. As CairnCorp®‘s planar location is optimized for ease of summoning[6], not dream intervention, the suggested campaign would have been operated in collaboration with the Daedric Prince Vaermina. However, the analyghasts foretold that such a campaign would draw interest to Vaermina’s plane of Quagmire more than to the Soul Cairn®, and it was ultimately concluded that the gains of the campaign would not outweigh its price. 
So you didn’t do it, but you did think about it. As in, it’s something a summoning plane might consider. Also, you implied you have a way to contact Vaermina? 
Although CairnCorp® highly discourages its customers from fraternizing with hazardous Daedric entities, most planes ruled by a Daedric Prince have a public number for business inquiries. The skeleton would be happy to forward your call to Quagmire, if you have questions about purchasing nightmares.
You might take the skeleton up on that offer later, you think in response. You’re still new to this conjuration stuff, and don’t really know how to reach places.

Being able to summon a teacher whenever you’ve got downtime would definitely be beneficial.
But, ah, before that: fourth question. I’m sorry if this is outside your plane’s specialty, but do you know anything about restoration magic?
The skeleton wishes it knew less about the BAD MAGIC.

While you don’t want to upset another space-skeleton, you cautiously push the topic further. Restoration magic means conjurers last longer, which means more conjurings. And that’s what CairnCorp (®, the skeleton adds) wants, right? Repeat customers? 
The skeleton acknowledges that the BAD MAGIC is indeed a method conjurers may utilize to prolong their living state, although its use is heavily discouraged by CairnCorp®. If customers are concerned about personal safety, it is recommended that they prepare their paperwork well in advance† and keep a skeletal minion on hand at all times, as this provides protection without endorsing the school of Restoration. 
Sensing your confusion, the skeleton explains further. CairnCorp® is one of the few conjuration planes to offer undead servants, meaning your summons are not only of the highest quality[1], but immune to poisons, exhaustion, and mind control that would affect a conventional Daedric summon‡. However, their undead nature also means they are uniquely susceptible to several forms of specialized magical combat utilized by a very small number[2] of mages. Most of these spells focus on temporarily breaking the bonekin’s link to the Masters®, but those versed in the BAD MAGIC often take a more heinous path, tampering with the bonekin’s very past.

A bonekin targeted by these spells will find itself having lived the most unspeakable of horrors. We recall every sight, feeling, and sensation as though it was our own. It weighs heavily on our shredded and reconstituted souls, leaving us shaken to our very core until our bi-hourly mind wipe. 
Oh, wow. I’m… sorry I brought it up? 
From now on I’ll be careful talking about restora-shin!
Like the tibia kind of shin, which is a bone.

So, ah, you seem very good at staying hydrated. Is there a dignified way to drink from a dish?
While there is very little about this in the etiquette knowledge the Makers® have supplied, the skeleton’s limited information suggests the proper route is to place your fingers in a circle around the rim, stabilizing the edges of the dish as you bring it to your mouth.

Don’t worry, you’re still watching the road!
Nobody has shown up since the textile merchant. At most, you’ve seen a few deer. 
You have been trying to slightly increase the time between checks, hoping that this will jinx Asotil into walking past the city just in time for you to notice him walking away and chase after him. So far, this has not worked, and you may need some stronger type of jinx-magic. 
His name is now Quentin. His favorite food is chamomile tea and he wants to learn woodworking so he can start a shop selling children’s toys that help teach math. It would be emotionally devastating if Asotil showed up and stepped on him.
In retrospect, jinx-magic might not actually be a real thing. Taking a more proactive approach, you turn your attention back to the skeleton.
You think about your predicament. You are waiting for a friend to show up, but don’t know when he is going to arrive. You don’t want to leave this rock, lest it cause you to miss him, but you would like to search around and see if there are any better vantage points. Would it be okay to maybe pull the skeleton over to Nirn to act as an extra pair of eye… sockets?
The skeleton delightedly informs you that guard duty is a perfectly acceptable and encouraged use of your CairnCorp® bonekin. According to its readings, however, you have insufficient magical energy to perform a conjuration at this time.
Wait – you can see how much magicka I have? 
Of course it can read your mana quantity, the skeleton thinks. In order to provide an optimal conjuration experience, CairnCorp® carefully monitors numerous‡ attributes of customer wellbeing. Your mana quantity is among these.
Can you, like… tell me how much I have? Because I don’t exactly know how to tell.
Certainly! Would you prefer it in metric or Imperial?
Oh! I mean… like, on one hand, I recognize metric is better. Everything being based off multiples of ten just makes sense, you know? But on the other hand, the Empire’s units are what I grew up with. When someone says “one meter”, there’s still this split-second thought of “oh, so about three feet”, and I don’t know if that ever fully goes away. It feels like I still think in Imperial, but on some level I also feel an obligation to try to stand against that. Like, to force myself to use metric units until I stop instinctively converting them in my head and instead just feel comfortable thinking of one meter as one meter.
The skeleton asks you to confirm it understands correctly: you would like the measurement in Imperial.
… Yes, please.
The skeleton informs you that you have one and a half gallons of magicka. 
Ah… how much is that?
About five and a half liters.
No, I mean, like… how much does it take to do a conjuration spell?
It varies based on the conjurer’s skill, the skeleton thinks in response. For a caster of your demographics, a basic bonekin conjuration would take approximately twice the amount of mana you currently have, or three gallons. Based on your personal conjuration history, it is estimated the spell would take approximately sixteen times as much mana as you currently have, or twenty four gallons.
Let me guess: this is because of all those pictures I drew on the way there last time, isn’t it?
The skeleton notes that drawing pictures with a leyline you actually intend to use is, in practical terms, a terrible idea that would be met with ridicule were the skeleton capable of such behavior. But because the glorious Makers® have freed the skeleton of such vices, it instead commends you on your creativity and dedication to the arts.

Add one to your HUD.LaffinFox wrote: Katia: See if you can imagine a sort of visual aid, like a gauge or something, to measure your remaining magicka? Something along the lines of what you did to manage your inventory perhaps.
Knowing that you have one and a half gallons of magicka isn’t exactly enough for you to make a gauge out of it. You’d still need to know what total amount that is out of, and have some way to tell how much it’s changing by each time you cast a spell. 
The first question, though, might have an easy solution. You direct your thoughts back to the skeleton and wonder how much magicka it would take before your tank is full.
The skeleton forewarns that it was not created to display magical aptitude, and only possesses the basic magical knowledge the Makers® have decreed necessary for client relations†. As it understands things, however, the question isn’t “how large your mana tank is”, but rather, “how much mana you can wield control over”. Have you ever siphoned power from a soul fissure?
No, you think in response.
Have you ever attempted to animate a nonstandard skeletal construct with more bones than the soul bound to it originally possessed?
No, I haven’t.
Have you ever used alteration spells to warp a larger area to fit within a smaller area of a different shape?
No, I don’t… think so, but will admit a degree of ambiguity on that one.
Well, storing mana for spellcasting is like any of those things you haven’t done. There is no maximum amount one can carry so much as there is a functional limit to what an individual can learn how to manipulate. 
Oh! So it’s kind of like finding how much you can lift? You just have to keep picking up weights and see at what point you can’t do it?
The skeleton supposes so, though such an analogy seems unnecessarily abstract and difficult for CairnCorp®‘s clientele to relate to. If you would like to estimate the upper limit of your mana-wielding capabilities, the simplest route would be to gather or generate mana and take note of the point at which you can wield no more. 
You can’t generate your own magicka, so doing a test like that isn’t exactly… easy for you, you admit. 
Oh, right, you forgot you have money now. Everything is easy for you. 
You splurge and drop 221 septims on the strongest magicka potion you can find. The skeleton informs you that you now have approximately seven and a quarter gallons of magicka. Nice.
You ask the skeleton if that’s a good amount for a mage to cap out at. It ponders the question for a minute, then explains that its etiquette training suggests an abrupt change in topic. How’s the weather on Nirn?
It’s… Nirny, you guess. You’d say “normal”, but the meaning of that might be lost across planes. 
CatFriend wrote: Try cleaning up that leyline! Not like we have anything better to do.N4Ian wrote: Ask the skeleton if there’s a way of make the summon cost lower, or if there a faster way to increase your mana, maybe both.
Before you go and blow a hundred septims worth of magicka on a summoning spell, you check with the skeleton as to whether there are any ways to bring the spell’s magicka cost lower. Like, are there… better ways to cast it? You’re already cleaning up the blue squiggle.
The skeleton tells you that the mana usage of star-tesseract-style conjuration predominantly comes down to the efficiency of the leyline. A straight line will be more efficient than the one used during your previous summon, but conjurers with more experience navigating the planar layout can typically forge a route shorter than a straight line. Routing through smaller planes helps. 
You don’t suppose there’s a map available explaining the shortest route? 
An nth-dimensional map such as that would be very difficult to portray in a two- or three-dimensional model. Celestial routing efficiency is typically‡ regarded as a skill conjurers pick up through experience. CairnCorp®‘s official stance[1] is that conjuration technique is best improved through regular and repeated conjurations with CairnCorp®.
But like, we’re already telepathically communicating. Is there no way to just transfer the maps into my head? 
It stresses that this is a front-level mental link through a long-distance leyline. What you are asking would require transferring a conjurer’s actual experiences navigating starmaps.
You said there were magical ways to shift experiences from one person to another, right? Is that something I could use here? Like, could I get a more experienced conjurer to use that experience-tampering magic you mentioned to show me how he-
Oh. Okay.
Huh, maybe you should’ve actually read this book rather than just idly holding it that entire time. You didn’t even get a chance to take up the skeleton’s offer to connect you to Vaermina’s plane. 
Though, if what it said about bi-hourly mind wipes is true, you guess you can just try again in half an hour. 
Or two hours. It’s weird that ambiguity still exists telepathically.

The skeleton’s thoughts about restoration magic implied it might actually be able to make you better at other types of magic. If restoration magic is really that powerful, you doubt using it is as simple as thinking happy thoughts or believing in yourself. 
Or eating a book about it. 
As for Asotil, you’ve been giving the road regular checks and the most you’ve seen is a trapper carrying some rabbits. The sun is going down, though, so it’s pretty likely Asotil’s schedule was shifted six hours forward and he’ll show up in a couple hours. 
You… guess if you have a full tank of magic, a temporary block on summoning, and no apparent route forward with restoration, it’s time to try the lightning spell. 
You doubt you’ll have time to get much of a handle on it before Asotil shows up like he said he would, but… yeah.

You’re not going to leave now, when Asotil is probably only an hour or two from arriving. He explicitly told you he was going to get his schedule shifted by six hours, and that he was going to meet up with you and travel back. 
Even if he got reassigned to another road or something, there would still be an Imperial Legionnaire patrolling this one. When they come by the town – apparently six hours later than normal – you will be briefly sad that they’re not Asotil, but you’ll still travel with them. 
And on the off-chance that every Legionnaire was suddenly recalled for an emergency or something, you’d still like to ensure your safety by traveling with someone else. Maybe the textile merchant or Dagon cultist have a reason to go to the coast?
You really don’t want to head out on your own. Not when overconfidence has screwed you so many times.

It’s still not much of a meter when you can’t tell how much it’s changing, but you straighten up the magicka bar a bit and make it a clothing-coordinated shade of blue.
You’d make a better one, but you’re pretty sure all your imagination-juice is currently going toward this extremely vivid snake you keep adding things to.

You still have sweetrolls! In fact, ten hours of eating sweetrolls and giving them to everyone who walks past has only taken you about halfway through this 24-pack. 
You could run into town and get some real food, but you’re worried straying from the rock for too long will cause you to miss Asotil. Also, you kind of feel like you deserve this sickeningly sweet fate for buying five pounds of sweetrolls. It’s a complicated feeling.
Anyway, let’s learn about zapping things.
Part One. Introduction.
Lightning is the art of friction.
It is the broil of clouds against the night sky. It is the crackling drag of fabric against fabric. It is the slow burn that drains our power as we pull magicka through the fibrous aether, and to wield the spark as your weapon is to embrace and unleash the friction that the unenlightened mage laments as his detriment. 
Some among the scholarly elite contend that the destruction mage’s reliance upon emotion is “brutish.” And I confess, when it comes to the sting of angst that ignites a flame spell, or the cold focus of frost, I find that my field’s detractors and I begrudgingly agree. To call forth the echo of thunder, however, is not to regard emotions as your weapon, but as the terrain upon which you fight. It is to draw your unformed energies through the tangled conflict of thought, allowing whatever change the burn of friction may inflict upon them.
Oh good, it’s flowery bullshit. You were worried something meaningful might happen today. 
Trying to learn a bunch of new magic skills all at once might be biting off more than you can chew, yeah. Especially trying to learn them over the course of twelve hours, and without sleep. 
To show the flowery metaphor book how dumb it is, you imagine up a big clump of magicka and, as per its suggestion, drag it through what you can only assume is a giant mess of overthinking that surrounds you.

Nevermind, forget pessimism! You know exactly how you’re going to spend the next two hours until Asotil shows up.
Alright, wait, nevermind again. You’ve apparently lost your internal conflict and uncertainty, and now lightning doesn’t work. 
If nothing else, you’ve at least set a new record for how quickly your hopes can be raised and dashed. If being happy you learned a spell is all it takes to steal it from you, you don’t think you’ll ever be able to do it reliably.
NEVERMIND THAT FIXED IT.
That’s the trick. All you have to do is keep your fuzzy mess of crippling self-doubt there so you have something to drag the magic through, and you have this in the bag. 
This form of magic really isn’t compatible with your style of thinking.

I’ve heard the best way to unlock the inner machinations of someone’s mind is through one’s stomach, and it seems clear that the overexcessiveness of sweetrolls is rotting your brain and/or magicka.
But hark: there are learned tomes awaiting consumption upon that rock! For your brain!
And your mouth.
What I’m saying is: eat the book Katia, unlock its wisdom. BE THE READER!
If the intro section alone was enough to let you cast a lightning spell, then the other two hundred pages can probably help you get a better handle on it. 
You pick up the book and read it like a normal, sophisticated person, rather than trying to eat it. 
The dancing arc is a river. It does not crash in waves as the sea, or hold its form as the glacier. It is the partner of the riverbed, and she alone decides where it ought wander, and whether the journey will be smooth or tumultuous. Her banks give it shape, her stones danger, and her narrows speed. To lead in this dance is to take the role of the river. The arc flows where and how it must. 
But as all that invokes the scrape of one force against another, even the riverbed is subject to friction. If not carefully maintained, its rapids smooth and its banks widen. To wield the bolt is to shape oneself as needed and be the conduit through which force travels. It is a task to which not all are well-suited, and those of weaker will may find more success among the mud-caked savages spewing flame and frost.
You’re on the fence as to whether you should feel offended by that because you mostly do fire, or embrace elitism because you also managed some lightning.

You decide to go for the safe middle ground of being mildly offended while also recognizing that you are pretty cool.
Protecting yourself against dark elf bandits would be handy, yeah, if they didn’t basically all live on the other side of the country. The chances of you running into something fireproof are pretty low. 
Plus, if you remember The Encyclopedia of Deadly Creatures correctly, the only creatures particularly vulnerable to lightning are Daedra, which aren’t even native to this plane of existence. Someone like Sigrid might pull them here from time to time, but it’s not like you’re going to get accosted by an angry Daedroth on the city streets. In practical terms, you’re probably better off spending time practicing your fire.
Still, learning a new type of magic is an accomplishment. Maybe you can celebrate by treating yourself to some…
… cake.
Alright, maybe not more cake. You could do your other favorite thing and…
… read a book about magic.
Oh gods, you’ve hit rock top.
Lacking other options, you give yourself a celebratory low-five for becoming a master of the arcane arts. At least you’ll be able to show it off to Asotil when he arrives.

He said he was getting his schedule shifted six hours.
That could have meant eleven in the morning, or it could’ve meant eleven at night. And since he didn’t show up at eleven in the morning, he’ll presumably be here in two hours. Or maybe a little earlier or later, depending how many potentially-dangerous wild animals he had to stop and kill. 
Nothing out of the ordinary has happened yet. You’ve just been waiting out here all day to be absolutely sure you don’t miss him.
Again, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. You’re sure Asotil is fine.
